// The perf HUD's `workers` phase in WORKER mode must be the WALL time of the
// guest rendezvous, not the main guest worker's self-reported slice time.
//
// `other` is a residual -- lib/perf-hud.js computes it as
// total - main - workers - present -- so anything a step spends outside the
// marked regions lands there anonymously. The worker run loop parks on
// `await Promise.all([runMain(), runThreads()])` and then marked `workers` as
// `r.ms`, the value the MAIN guest worker reported for its own slice. Two
// things were wrong with that: an awaited call does block the step (it is an
// async function), and r.ms says nothing about the other guest threads, which
// is where most of the work is.
//
// Measured on a real iPhone running StarCraft, 69910 steps over 49s: 67.8% of
// wall clock was inside the awaited runWorkerSlices, only 3.3% of it
// synchronous. The HUD drew that as main 0% / workers ~0% / other 40-55% -- a
// fully busy machine reported as idle.
//
// Two halves are asserted here: that host.js measures the rendezvous rather
// than reading r.ms, and that perf-hud's residual really does absorb an
// under-marked phase (so the reasoning above is the mechanism, not a guess).
