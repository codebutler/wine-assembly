// One failed draw must not kill the render worker.
//
// The receiver marks a device's stream failed when a command throws, and that
// is right: the commands behind it are ordered against state the failure left
// undefined, so drain() answers each of them 'failed' rather than running it.
// What was wrong was the report channel for commands arriving AFTER that, which
// receive() answered by throwing. That throw escapes receive(), and
// lib/d3d-render-worker.js's top-level message handler treats any throw as
// fatal: it calls shutdownNeutral() and lets the thread exit. From then on
// every command on EVERY device that worker serves raises 'render worker
// stopped', because there is no worker left to serve them.
//
// The failure is asynchronous, so a producer cannot avoid this by being
// careful -- it submits the next frame before it has been told the last draw
// failed. Measured on Black & White 2's land pass: the clipper refused one draw
// at command 8917, the worker was gone by 8918, and the run's remaining 587
// commands had nothing to run on. The rendered frame never changed again.
//
// Recovery from a failed stream is a device reset, which bumps the generation
// and rebuilds the stream -- and that is only reachable while the worker is
// still alive to receive it. So keeping the worker alive is what makes the
// existing recovery path usable at all, which is the last case here.
