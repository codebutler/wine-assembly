// A pixel shader may read v1 when nothing writes oD1; it reads zero.
//
// v1 is the specular input, and PS1.1 is entitled to read it. Whether it has a
// VALUE depends on the draw: a COLOR2 vertex attribute, fixed-function specular
// lighting, or a vertex shader writing oD1 all produce one. When none of the
// three is present, v1 is an interpolant with no source, and D3D9 calls that
// UNDEFINED -- the same class of state as sampling a stage with no texture
// bound (test-d3d9-unbound-sampler.js), and the same reason it must not be
// fatal: lib/d3d-command-stream.js makes the queue's error sticky, so one
// refused draw ends rendering for the whole run.
//
// The conservative answer costs nothing to produce. $d3d_shader_vm_context
// memory.fills the entire VM context, and the VM already bounds bank 1 to
// index < 2, so an input register nothing writes reads (0,0,0,0) on every lane.
// The refusal was JavaScript-side only.
//
// What this pins is the boundary, not just the permission: when a producer
// DOES exist, serving zero would be a lie about a real specular colour rather
// than a reading of an undefined one. A vertex shader writing oD1 is served
// for real now (test-d3d9-specular-varying.js owns that linkage); a COLOR2
// vertex attribute has no lowering yet and is still refused. Measured on
// Black & White 2's land pass: 58 of 464 shaded draws read v1, every one of
// them fixed-function with no COLOR2 and specular lighting off.
