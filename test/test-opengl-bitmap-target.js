// PFD_DRAW_TO_BITMAP: a GL context created on a *memory* DC does not draw into
// any window. Its drawable is the DIB section selected into that DC, and the
// application blits those bits somewhere else with ordinary GDI afterwards.
//
// SimGolf renders its entire course that way. The WGL bridge used to fall back
// to $main_hwnd whenever a DC had no owning window, so the frame was published
// as a window layer while the DIB the game actually blits from stayed black:
// the course was missing and the interface drawn over it was perfect. The WAT
// side now hands the host the selected bitmap's surface id with the high bit
// set, and the bridge publishes into that surface's canonical bits.
