// On Windows the GL drawable IS the window's client area. Resize the window and
// the next frame comes out at the new size, with no API call in between saying
// so -- the app just calls glViewport with its new client rect and draws.
//
// Our canvas was sized once, in createContext, and never again. Warcraft III is
// where that showed: its startup runs the whole GL setup twice, and between the
// two it does SW_MINIMIZE then SW_MAXIMIZE, so the client area it finally lays
// its menu out in is the desktop. Measured in the browser, the guest was calling
// glViewport(0, 0, 940, 734) into an 800x600 canvas. A viewport bigger than the
// drawable is CLIPPED, not scaled, so what reached the screen was the corner of
// the menu the old surface happened to cover -- and worse, every coordinate read
// off that picture was in the wrong space, so a click at the pixel where a
// button appeared went somewhere else entirely in the game's own layout.
//
// Both halves are checked here: the drawable follows the window, and it does so
// AFTER the frame is published, because resetRenderTargets reallocates the
// colour and depth attachments and doing that mid-frame throws away whatever the
// guest had already drawn.
