// $gdi_raster_bitblt_fast32 hands a blit back to the generic per-pixel path by
// returning -1, and until now it did so anonymously. That mattered because a
// decline is not a small cost: the generic loop re-resolves the clip and the
// DC state for every pixel of the blit, which on Diablo's Choose Class screen
// was about three quarters of all CPU. Which gate fired decides what is worth
// widening, and "this app never takes the fast blit" and "it takes it and that
// is not where the time goes" are opposite conclusions that look identical
// without the reason.
//
// So each gate now counts itself, and this test pins the mapping: it drives a
// blit that can only fail for one reason and demands that reason's counter --
// and only that one -- move. A gate that is renumbered or quietly reordered
// fails here rather than silently mislabelling a future profile.
