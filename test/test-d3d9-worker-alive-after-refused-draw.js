// The REAL render worker thread survives a draw the rasterizer refuses.
//
// test-d3d9-worker-survives-draw-failure.js pins the receiver's behaviour in
// isolation, but the bug being fixed did not live in the receiver -- it lived
// in what the receiver's throw reached. lib/d3d-render-worker.js wraps its
// whole message handler in one try/catch whose catch calls shutdownNeutral();
// the thread's event loop then has nothing left to keep it alive and the
// process exits. So the property worth pinning end to end is that the worker
// THREAD is still running afterwards, and still serving other devices.
//
// The failing draw here is a real refusal from the native rasterizer, not a
// stubbed throw: a clip-space triangle with one vertex at a positive but tiny
// w. The clipper's post-plane compaction keeps every vertex whose w > 0, and
// $d3d_software_project then computes 1/w and refuses the draw when that
// overflows FLT_MAX -- which happens for every w below about 3e-39. That is a
// genuine -1 out of $d3d_software_step, the same shape of failure Black &
// White 2's land pass hit at command 8917 and which took the worker with it.
