  ;; 07c-block-exec.wat -- a per-BLOCK executor for every basic block.
  ;;
  ;; docs/block-executor-design.md is the design; this is the prototype it
  ;; describes. Default OFF ($block_exec_enabled), decode-time gate.
  ;;
  ;; The claim being tested, from docs/dispatch-attribution-2026-09.md: the
  ;; per-op `call_indirect` is 18-19% of guest CPU and the $get_reg/$set_reg
  ;; br_table register file another 8-12%, on three apps whose blocks are 3.5,
  ;; 4.3 and 7.0 ops long. Holding the eight GPRs in wasm LOCALS for the length
  ;; of one block deletes the second outright and most of the first, and
  ;; docs/region-descriptor-bench-2026-09.md measured that mechanism at
  ;; +29..46% on straight-line blocks of 2 to 32 ops with no crossover.
  ;;
  ;; Two structural decisions, both argued in the design doc:
  ;;
  ;;   1. THE TERMINATOR STAYS THREADED. The descriptor covers ops [0, n-1) and
  ;;      the block's real terminator is re-emitted after it, untouched. That
  ;;      keeps $decode_run's fall-through adjacency alive (it reads the last
  ;;      OP_INDEX entry and requires optr + 16 == d_block_end), keeps
  ;;      $page_retire_at's 8-byte stamp landing on the block's first op, and
  ;;      means call/ret/loop/jecxz/far-jmp/H404/H407 need no executor code at
  ;;      all. Cost: one dispatch per block. A block of N ops goes N -> 2.
  ;;
  ;;   2. UNIMPLEMENTED OPS RUN THE REAL HANDLER. Registers spill to the
  ;;      globals, the handler is called, the registers reload. Every $th_* ends
  ;;      in `return_call $next`, so the copied words are followed by an op
  ;;      naming $th_bx_resume (H459), whose empty body returns -- and because
  ;;      the whole chain is tail calls, that return lands back in THIS frame.
  ;;      The fallback share is the migration progress meter.
  ;;
  ;; The micro-op encoding is H454's ($TU_* in 07b-loop-match.wat) and so is the
  ;; classifier ($tree_uop_classify). There is one encoding and one classifier;
  ;; what this file adds is a second EXECUTOR, which exists only because a wasm
  ;; local cannot cross a function boundary -- the exact property the design
  ;; exploits. See OPEN-2 in the design doc.

  ;; The install FLOOR, and it is a measured crossover, not a taste. A
  ;; descriptor pays a fixed entry/exit cost (park $steps, run the loop, publish
  ;; eight GPRs and $ea_temp, recompute $steps) against a saving that is
  ;; per-micro-op, so it only wins once the block is long enough. From
  ;; `tools/bench-loops.js --toggle=block_exec` (7 interleaved reps, minima):
  ;; blk2 -1.9%, blk4 +4.7%, blk8 -0.9%, blk16 +22.0%, blk32 +36.2%. Heroes II
  ;; at a floor of 2 is a *resolved loss* of 0.36s on 3.08s (its blocks are
  ;; short and 37% of its ops fall back); at 12 the same A/B is unresolvable,
  ;; and MW3 at 12 is a resolved gain of 0.40s on 8.54s. Lower it with
  ;; --block-exec-min-uops for a correctness sweep, where coverage is the point.

  ;; plus a register op reading it, and which lane that is lives in `d` and in

  ;; ROUND 18 (section 28): THE UNMODELLED-TERMINATOR SIDE EXIT.
  ;; ======================================================================
  ;; `termNotModelled` -- a block ending in a call, a ret, an indirect branch,
  ;; a `loop`/`jecxz`, an int, a far jump, or one of the fused Jcc forms the
  ;; classifier will not read -- was the top classify refusal in five of six
  ;; apps (section 14.2). Such a block was not a member at all, so its BODY --
  ;; which is ordinary code the executor can run perfectly well -- was left on
  ;; the threaded path together with its terminator, and the region stopped at
  ;; the edge into it.
  ;;
  ;; This admits it as a member with `term_kind 10`: the body runs natively
  ;; like any other member's, and then the member SIDE-EXITS into threaded
  ;; execution at its OWN terminator -- publish all eight, `$ip <- this
  ;; member's tail`, `return_call $next` -- exactly as the one-block
  ;; `term_kind 5` path does. Nothing about call/ret semantics is modelled.
  ;;
  ;; Section 14.6 said this "needs a per-block tail pointer first", because
  ;; `$tail_ip` is one value derived from the descriptor header. The per-member
  ;; pointer costs NO new descriptor words: a `term_kind 10` member evaluates
  ;; no condition and has no in-region successor, so `term_a`/`term_b`/
  ;; `term_uop`/`term_imm`/`term_cc`/`succ_taken`/`succ_fall` are all dead for
  ;; it. `term_imm` (record word 7) carries the BYTE OFFSET of this member's
  ;; copied terminator within the descriptor's fallback pool, and the executor
  ;; reads `tail = $fbp + term_imm`. $REGION_BLOCK_WORDS is unchanged, every
  ;; existing descriptor is byte-identical, and the single-`$tail_ip` fast path
  ;; is untouched for a region that has no such member.
  ;;
  ;; A `term_kind 10` member is a DEAD END in the region graph: it has zero
  ;; interior successors. A call's fall-through is deliberately not one -- the
  ;; callee runs threaded and returns to call+5 through `$branch_end`, which
  ;; re-enters the page index like any other transfer, and (since round 13) a
  ;; region's index footprint is its HEAD BLOCK ONLY, so call+5 keeps its own

  ;; `d` therefore does NOT name a destination register here. That is safe

  ;; THE MULTI-BLOCK MATCHER (OPEN-2)
  ;;
  ;; Everything above builds a ONE-block descriptor. The executor has always

  ;; of retired guest ops on a six-app corpus sit inside a 2-4 block region and
  ;; 4.4% inside a 5-16 block one. This is what builds those descriptors from
  ;; real code.
  ;;
  ;; WHERE THE BLOCKS COME FROM, and why there is no second decoder. A region
  ;; needs the micro-ops of several blocks at once, and a block's micro-ops
  ;; only exist for the instant between $decode_block emitting it and the next
  ;; $decode_block overwriting OP_INDEX. $decode_run already walks exactly the
  ;; set of blocks this wants -- the fall-through chain out of one entry, in
  ;; ascending guest address, inside one page, stopping at anything already
  ;; compiled -- so the matcher rides along with it:
  ;;
  ;;   $decode_run(eip)      -> $bx_region_begin(eip)
  ;;     $decode_block(b0)   -> $bx_region_collect(b0)   [before every matcher]
  ;;     $decode_block(b1)   -> $bx_region_collect(b1)
  ;;     ...
  ;;                         -> $bx_region_finish()
  ;;
  ;; Each collect classifies that block's ops into $BX_RG_BASE while they are
  ;; still there and then gets out of the way; the per-block matchers run after
  ;; it exactly as before, so a member keeps whatever one-block descriptor it
  ;; would have had. Nothing is decoded twice and no block is decoded that
  ;; $decode_run was not going to decode anyway, which is why the matcher's own
  ;; decode-time cost is a classify pass and nothing else.
  ;;
  ;; WHAT THE SET LOOKS LIKE. Members are guest-contiguous by construction (the
  ;; chain follows fall-throughs), so the region's guest extent is exactly
  ;; [head, last block's end) with no holes. That is what makes the SMC story
  ;; the EXISTING one rather than a new generation counter: $page_publish marks
  ;; every byte of that extent as covered by the region, so a write anywhere
  ;; inside any member retires the whole region, and the region's own publish
  ;; retires the member entries it subsumes. Entry is through the head only --
  ;; a jump INTO a member lands on a cover mark, misses, and re-decodes that
  ;; block, which symmetrically retires the region. That is the "or decline"
  ;; arm of the entry rule, self-healing rather than checked, and the thrash
  ;; table below is what stops the two from ping-ponging forever.
  ;;
  ;; The rules are docs/region-census-2026-09.md's, one for one:
  ;;   single entry          the head; interior entries retire the region
  ;;   <= 16 blocks          $REGION_MAX_BLOCKS
  ;;   <= 8 exits            $REGION_MAX_EXITS
  ;;   uop budget            derived from the 4096-byte emit slack, below
  ;;   one page              $decode_run's own rule, inherited
  ;;   no call/ret/int/indirect inside   $bx_op_unsafe on every body op; a
  ;;                         terminator that is not a foldable Jcc or an
  ;;                         unconditional jump simply ends the region, so the
  ;;                         edge into such a block becomes an exit
  ;;   every op a micro-op   $tree_uop_classify, or a FALLBACK micro-op

  ;; from one hot head, decoding on demand inside the head's page.

  ;; What it keeps from round 9, unchanged and deliberately so:
  ;;   * the descriptor, the classifier, the executor, the exit table;
  ;;   * the SMC story -- the region is published over ONE contiguous guest
  ;;     span [head, max member end), $page_publish retires every old block it
  ;;     touches, and a write anywhere inside retires the region;
  ;;   * the 64-slot thrash guard.
  ;; What that span costs is the one new rule: **every member must start at or
  ;; above the head**, so the head is the lowest address in the region and the
  ;; published entry point is the span's first byte. An edge to a lower address
  ;; is simply an exit. Without it $page_retire_at, which infers a block's
  ;; extent by walking out over equal chunk offsets, would break the chunk with
  ;; the span's low byte as the resume address and a later entry at the head
  ;; would jump into the middle of its own region.
  ;;
  ;; Bytes inside the span that belong to no member are covered by the region

  ;; ROUND 12 (section 18) -- CARRY LOAD FACTS ACROSS A REGION EDGE.
  ;;
  ;; Section 16.2's rule already permits a carry along an edge whose target has
  ;; a single predecessor inside the region; round 11's implementation took the
  ;; conservative end of that permission and carried nothing, because the edge
  ;; set is not resolved until every member has been classified. This runs
  ;; after it is, over the members in index order, re-walking each one's
  ;; micro-ops -- and seeding the fact table from the previous member's exit
  ;; state exactly when that member is the target's ONE in-region predecessor.
  ;;
  ;; Three things make the seed sound, and all three are the existing rule
  ;; rather than a new one:
  ;;
  ;;  * A region is only ever ENTERED at its head. A member reached from
  ;;    outside gets decoded as a block of its own, which retires the region
  ;;    ($bx_rg_thrash_ok), so "one predecessor inside the region" really is
  ;;    "one predecessor".
  ;;  * Everything that kills a fact inside a block still kills it: this is the
  ;;    same walk, so a store on the carried edge, an unmodelled op, a
  ;;    fallback, an x87 op or a write to a fact's base register all kill
  ;;    exactly as they did within one block.
  ;;  * The FOLDED TERMINATOR on the carried edge kills too, through
  ;;    $bx_opt_term_wreg: term_kind 0/8/9 write $term_a and are not in the
  ;;    micro-op list, so without that kill a carry would step straight over a
  ;;    `inc esi` / `add esi,4` that moved the base.
  ;;
  ;; Restricting the seed to `pred == m - 1` is an implementation limit, not the
  ;; rule: seeding from an arbitrary predecessor means storing one fact table
  ;; per member, while walking members in index order gives the m-1 case for
  ;; free. Every other single-predecessor edge is counted in $bx_carry_refused,
  ;; which is exactly the measure of what a per-member table would add.
  ;;
  ;; Walk 2 is deliberately NOT re-run. It deletes micro-ops, and $total plus
  ;; every member's uop_off were fixed when it ran; walk 1 only rewrites one in
  ;; place, so the descriptor's shape is untouched by this pass.

  ;; never arise; here the sentinel makes the two paths differ silently, and
  ;; `test/test-block-exec.js`'s "a store through a null base register" case is
  ;; the one that caught it. Nothing at decode time can prove an address is
  ;; mapped, so the transform is dropped rather than guarded. REDUNDANT-LOAD

  ;; region descriptor over the $TU_* micro-op vocabulary, and $th_block_exec
  ;; here ran a per-block descriptor over a second, DENSE re-encoding of a
  ;; subset of the same vocabulary. Two interpreters over one classifier is a
  ;; place for the two to disagree about what a micro-op means, so they are one
  ;; interpreter now, over one descriptor format:
  ;;
  ;;   a BLOCK is a 1-block region with no back edge (term_kind 5, the
  ;;     terminator left in the thread stream after the descriptor),
  ;;   a SELF-LOOP FOLD is a 1-block region whose taken successor is itself,
  ;;   a REGION is N <= $REGION_MAX_BLOCKS blocks with interior edges.

  ;; per-exit live-out mask and the folded Jcc terminator from H454, and the
  ;; FALLBACK micro-op (run the real handler, spill and reload) plus the stack
  ;; forms from H458. The kind space is $TU_* directly -- there is no second

  ;; H463 -- THE ONE-BLOCK LEAF (round 16, section 25 of the design doc)
  ;; ======================================================================
  ;; Section 13.7's open item, and the review's round-14 experiment #2: the
  ;; merged executor is ONE large wasm function, and the 1-block case is the
  ;; one that amortizes its prologue over the fewest micro-ops -- which is
  ;; exactly what section 13.5 measured as blk16 losing 17 points and blk32 20
  ;; when H454 and H458 became one function.
  ;;
  ;; So the common install gets its own entry point. What is NOT here, against
  ;; $th_block_exec: the trip loop and its thirteen per-block record loads, the
  ;; five terminator `br_table`s and the flag helpers under them, `$eval_cc`,
  ;; the exit table, the per-exit live-out mask, the interior-breakpoint side
  ;; exit, the step/budget safepoint, the parked `$steps` counter, the fallback
  ;; spill/`call_indirect`/reload pair and the per-region-size histogram. What
  ;; IS here is the micro-op body loop, byte for byte the same code, and the
  ;; publish that follows it.
  ;;
  ;; THE CONTRACT, which $block_exec_try_install enforces at emit time:
  ;;   nblocks == 1, nexits == 0, term_kind == 5 (threaded tail),
  ;;   no TU_FALLBACK and no TU_X87RUN micro-op.
  ;; Every one of those is a property of the descriptor's bytes, and a
  ;; descriptor is immutable once emitted -- an SMC write drops the whole page
  ;; rather than editing it -- so the two arms this function cannot run are
  ;; `unreachable` rather than guarded.
  ;;
  ;; THE DUPLICATION IS DELIBERATE AND IS THE COST OF THE EXPERIMENT. WAT has
  ;; no way to share a body across two functions with different local sets,
  ;; and different local sets are the entire point: a local lives exactly one
  ;; function invocation. `tools/indirect-census.js --preset=block-exec` prints
  ;; both functions' sizes side by side, and test/test-block-exec.js runs the
  ;; same 269 differential cases through both arms of `--block-exec-leaf`, so a
  ;; body that drifts is a failing test rather than a silent divergence.

  ;; ======================================================================
  ;; Section 25.4 named the next question and 25.5 left it as the untouched
  ;; prize: a fallback-carrying one-block descriptor is 73% of executor
  ;; entries on both real windows, and it pays the WHOLE general region
  ;; function -- 10,472 bytes and 14 data-dependent indirect sites -- for the
  ;; sake of one pushfd.
  ;;
  ;; This is $th_block_exec_leaf with arms 57 and 60 made real, and nothing
  ;; else. Against $th_block_exec it still carries none of the region
  ;; machinery: no trip loop and no thirteen per-block record loads, no five
  ;; terminator br_tables and no flag helpers under them, no $eval_cc, no exit
  ;; table, no per-exit live-out mask, no interior-breakpoint side exit, no
  ;; step/budget safepoint and no per-region-size histogram.
  ;;
  ;; WHY A SECOND FUNCTION AND NOT AN ARM ON THE FIRST. The pure leaf's
  ;; measured win is its size and its indirect-site count (section 25.1), and
  ;; a call_indirect in its body loop would add a data-dependent site to EVERY
  ;; descriptor, including the ones that never reach it. A separate entry
  ;; point leaves $th_block_exec_leaf byte-for-byte what it was, which makes
  ;; "the pure leaf did not regress" a property of the build rather than of a
  ;; measurement -- and section 27 checks it as a measurement anyway.
  ;;
  ;; THE CONTRACT, which $block_exec_try_install enforces at emit time:
  ;;   nblocks == 1, nexits == 0, term_kind == 5 (threaded tail).
  ;; It MAY carry TU_FALLBACK and TU_X87RUN micro-ops; those are the point.
