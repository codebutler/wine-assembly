  ;; CONTROL TABLE + BUILT-IN CONTROL WNDPROCS
  ;; ============================================================
  ;;
  ;; Two parallel mechanisms exist during the controls refactor:
  ;;
  ;;   (a) CONTROL_TABLE at WASM 0x2980 — legacy parallel array
  ;;       indexed by window slot. Holds (ctrl_class, ctrl_id, check_state).
  ;;       Populated by handle_CreateDialogParamA when JS creates a dialog
  ;;       template; consulted by BM_GETCHECK / BM_SETCHECK as a fallback.
  ;;       Slated for deletion in STEP 5+ once dialogs are built from WAT.
  ;;
  ;;   (b) Per-window state struct (ButtonState / StaticState / ...)
  ;;       allocated in $heap_alloc and pointed to by WND_RECORDS.state_ptr
  ;;       (via $wnd_set_state_ptr). Allocated in WM_CREATE, freed in
  ;;       WM_DESTROY. This is the new model — when state_ptr != 0 the
  ;;       wndproc treats this control as fully owned by WAT.
  ;;
  ;; ctrl_class values: 0=not a control, 1=Button, 2=Edit, 3=Static,
  ;;                    4=ListBox, 5=ComboBox, 6=ColorGrid, 7=ScrollBar,
  ;;                    8=TreeView, 9=Combo popup, 10+=WAT-built dialogs,
  ;;                    17=ProgressBar, 18=ListView, 19=TrackBar,
  ;;                    20=Tooltip, 21=Toolbar

  ;; ---- Per-class state struct layouts ----
  ;;
  ;; The wndproc that allocates the state struct in WM_CREATE is responsible
  ;; for freeing it AND any sub-allocations (text_buf_ptr) in WM_DESTROY,
  ;; then calling $wnd_set_state_ptr(hwnd, 0).
  ;;
  ;; WND_RECORDS.state_ptr IS A DISCRIMINATED UNION, NOT A STRUCT — and it is a
  ;; stronger union than GdiObject (docs/watx-layout-migration-design.md §5.4).
  ;; Two properties make it so:
  ;;
  ;;   (1) THERE IS NO SHARED PREFIX. GdiObject at least agreed on handle@0 and
  ;;       type@4, which is what `GdiObject` names. Here even +0 disagrees:
  ;;         Button/Static/Combo/Edit  +0 = text_buf_ptr, a GUEST POINTER
  ;;         Progress/TrackBar         +0 = min,          a signed integer
  ;;         ListBox                   +0 = items_buf_ptr, a GUEST POINTER
  ;;         ListView                  +0 = item_count,   a count
  ;;         ColorGrid                 +0 = sel_idx,      -1 when none
  ;;       so there is deliberately no `ControlStateAny` view below: there is
  ;;       nothing true to put in it. +8 is the sharpest single word — it is a
  ;;       Button's bit-field, a Static's SS_* enum, a Combo's full window
  ;;       style, a Progress/TrackBar POSITION, a ListBox byte CAPACITY, an
  ;;       Edit's char capacity, and a ListView's guest POINTER to the cell
  ;;       array. One (layout ControlState) would compile perfectly and be
  ;;       wrong at most of its sites.
  ;;
  ;;   (2) THE VARIANTS DO NOT EVEN SHARE A SIZE (8/12/16/20/24/40/44/56/72/80),
  ;;       so unlike GdiObject's uniform 48-byte record `size-of` pins nothing
  ;;       in common; each variant's size is its own allocation argument, cited
  ;;       per layout below.
  ;;
  ;;   (3) THE DISCRIMINANT IS NOT IN THE RECORD AT ALL. GdiObject carries its
  ;;       type at +4 and $gdi_object_delete_full dispatches on it. Here the
  ;;       tag lives entirely OUTSIDE: in CONTROL_TABLE.class (see the ctrl
  ;;       slot layout near $ctrl_slot_addr) and, operationally, in WHICH
  ;;       WNDPROC allocated the record — the wndproc that ran $heap_alloc in
  ;;       WM_CREATE is the only thing that knows what these bytes mean. So a
  ;;       variant cannot be chosen by reading the record; it is chosen by the
  ;;       class of the code holding the pointer.
  ;;
  ;; That last point is also why this family is nonetheless SAFE to convert,
  ;; and cheaper to attribute than GdiObject was: almost every raw site lives
  ;; in a function whose own name states the class ($btn_*, $static_*, $prog_*,
  ;; $trk_*, $lb_*, $cb_*, $lv_*, $edit_*, $colorspectrum_*, $toolbar_*). The
  ;; attribution is per FUNCTION, it is checked by tools/control-variant-gate.js,
  ;; and that gate refuses any new raw offset spelled against one of these
  ;; records in either the add form or the memarg form.
  ;;
  ;; A field a variant does not own is named `reserved*` rather than left
  ;; implicit, so reaching for it is an unknown-field compile error instead of
  ;; a plausible read (the GdiObject rule, and it applies unchanged here).

  ;; Button (ctrl_class 1). 68 bytes — $button_wndproc WM_CREATE heap_alloc 68.
  ;; flags@8 bit0=pressed bit1=checked bit2=default (the CURRENT paint default,
  ;; which flips on focus — $btn_clear_sibling_default / $btn_restore_real_default)
  ;; bit3=focused; read/written only through $btn_flags / $btn_set_flags, and by
  ;; $ctrl_get_check_state / $ctrl_set_check_state which shift bit1 out as the
  ;; legacy BM_GETCHECK answer.
  ;; drawitem@12 is a 48-byte DRAWITEMSTRUCT scratch embedded in the record, not
  ;; a field: $btn_drawitem_guest hands its GUEST address to the app's owner-draw
  ;; handler, so its 12 words are the app's to write. It is named, and named as
  ;; an array, precisely so that nothing in here can address into the middle of
  ;; it by accident.
  ;; NO ctrl_id HERE, deliberately: the child/menu id lives once, in
  ;; CONTROL_TABLE+4, and is read with $ctrl_table_get_id($hwnd). A second copy
  ;; in the record went stale the moment SetWindowLongA(GWL_ID) moved the table
  ;; entry, and every WM_COMMAND this control sent afterwards carried the old id.
