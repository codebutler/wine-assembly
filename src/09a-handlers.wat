  ;; WIN32 API HANDLER FUNCTIONS

  ;; RECT — the first CLASS-C layout (docs/watx-layout-migration-design.md
  ;; §7, wave 6). Class C is the guest's memory: the address descends from
  ;; $g2w, so these bytes belong to the application, and the offsets below
  ;; are not a choice we get to make.
  ;;
  (; FROZEN: RECT — Win32 ABI, windef.h. Four LONGs, in this order, and the
     guest binary already contains the compiled instructions that read them at
     these offsets. Moving one is not a refactor: it is a wire-format change,
     it traps nowhere, and it misreads every app at once.
     tools/gen-layout-offsets.js --check refuses any movement. ;)
  (layout Rect
    (field left   i32)    ;; +0
    (field top    i32)    ;; +4
    (field right  i32)    ;; +8
    (field bottom i32))   ;; +12  ends at +16 == sizeof(RECT)

  ;; A SECOND layout for the same C structure, deliberately, with the reason
  ;; stated as docs/watx-layout-migration-design.md §7 requires: `PaintRect`
  ;; (src/10-helpers.wat) describes a slot of the emulator's OWN PAINT_SCRATCH
  ;; ring, and that ring is NOT a RECT array. It hands out 16 opaque bytes and
  ;; three of its live slots are something else entirely — a "X, Y" status
  ;; string, a single '>' glyph byte, an address passed straight to $w2g. So
  ;; PaintRect cannot carry the FROZEN marker (its bytes are ours, and a slot
  ;; may legitimately stop being a rect), and `Rect` cannot be merged into it
  ;; (its bytes are Microsoft's, and must never stop being a rect). Same four
  ;; fields, opposite ownership.
  ;;
  ;; WHAT THE $g2w BASE DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE, because this is the finding
  ;; the class-C waves have to carry: `--base-local-from-call=$g2w` proves a
  ;; local holds a GUEST pointer. It does not prove WHICH guest structure,
  ;; because every class-C record in the tree arrives through the same one
  ;; call. Read at +0/+4/+8/+12 off a $g2w'd local, in this file alone:
  ;; $handle_GetSystemDirectoryA's `$dst` (an ANSI path buffer),
  ;; $handle_CoCreateGuid's `$wa` (a GUID) and $handle_GetLogicalDriveStringsW's
  ;; `$buf` (a UTF-16 buffer) are all indistinguishable from a rect to any
  ;; mechanical rule, and all three would convert BYTE-IDENTICALLY. So the
  ;; attribution here is the Win32 SIGNATURE — every converted function takes
  ;; an LPRECT at that argument position per the SDK — and it is spelled as an
  ;; explicit --only-func list in tools/build.sh, not derived.
  ;; =====================================================================

  ;; =====================================================================
  ;; POINT — the second CLASS-C layout, and the same ownership story as RECT
  ;; above: the address comes out of $g2w, the bytes are the application's,
  ;; and the two offsets are Microsoft's.
  ;;
  (; FROZEN: POINT — Win32 ABI, windef.h. Two LONGs, x then y, and the guest
     binary already contains the compiled instructions that read them at these
     offsets. Moving one is a wire-format change: it traps nowhere and
     misreads every app at once.

  (layout Point
    (field x i32)    ;; +0
    (field y i32))   ;; +4  ends at +8 == sizeof(POINT)

  ;; WHY THIS LAYOUT IS SMALL, and it is a finding about the tree and not
  ;; about POINT: almost every guest POINT in this emulator is touched through
  ;; the $gs32/$gl32 guest accessors, which take a GUEST address and are calls,
  ;; not `i32.load`/`i32.store` on a $g2w'd local. The layout system describes
  ;; the latter, so it cannot see the former at all. $handle_GetCursorPos,
  ;; $handle_GetViewportOrgEx, $handle_SetViewportOrgEx, $handle_GetWindowOrgEx,
  ;; $handle_SetWindowOrgEx, $handle_OffsetViewportOrgEx,
  ;; $handle_OffsetWindowOrgEx, $handle_GetCurrentPositionEx,
  ;; $handle_GetBrushOrgEx, $handle_DPtoLP and $handle_LPtoDP all take an
  ;; LPPOINT by their SDK prototype and are all declined for exactly that
  ;; reason — the access width and kind disagree with the field, not the name.
  ;; $handle_GetCaretPos is declined for a narrower one: its base is an inline
  ;; `(call $g2w …)` per access rather than a local, so there is no base local
  ;; to attribute. None of these is a judgement about whether the pointer is a
  ;; POINT; they all are.
  ;;
  ;; And the same $g2w warning as RECT applies with more force at eight bytes
  ;; than at sixteen. In src/09a7-handlers-dispatch.wat, $handle_GetDCOrgEx
  ;; (an LPPOINT, converted) and $handle_QueryPerformanceCounter (a
  ;; LARGE_INTEGER, NOT converted) sit four lines apart and write +0/+4 off a
  ;; $g2w'd local named `$wa` in the same shape. Both convert byte-identically
  ;; and one of them would be a lie. The --only-func list in tools/build.sh is
  ;; what separates them, and it is a claim about the SDK prototype.

  ;; ---- Timer table helpers ----
  ;; Timer table at 0x24C0: 16 entries × 20 bytes
  ;; Each entry: [hwnd:4][id:4][interval:4][last_tick:4][callback:4]
  ;; A zero hwnd/id pair means the slot is empty. Window-owned timers may use
  ;; ID 0 (Tetris does), while thread/callback timers have hwnd=0 and an
  ;; auto-generated nonzero ID.

  ;; $timer_set(hwnd, id, interval_ms, callback) — add or update a timer
  ;;
  ;; Locked for the same reason as the window table: this is a scan-then-claim
  ;; over a table every instance shares, so two threads calling SetTimer at the
  ;; same instant can both settle on the same free slot and one timer never
  ;; fires. The clock read is deliberately OUTSIDE the lock — it is a host
  ;; import, and rule 1 on $lock_acquire is that a section holding a spinlock
  ;; must not make one: in worker mode that call blocks in Atomics.wait for the
  ;; main thread, which may itself be spinning for this lock.
