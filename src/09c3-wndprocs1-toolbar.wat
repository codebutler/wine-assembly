  ;; this child with MFC's CToolBar proc, then chains TB_* messages to the
  ;; previous wndproc through CallWindowProcA. Returning a real button count and
  ;; button geometry is enough for MFC's WM_SIZEPARENT layout to allocate a
  ;; visible toolbar instead of collapsing it to its border height.

  ;; and the toolbar then moves it to the button rect, 110 wide. Nothing
  ;; resized the inner edit and listbox, so a 268-wide edit stayed sitting
  ;; across the 110-wide control: it covered the drop arrow (which is why the
  ;; box appeared to have none) and it swallowed clicks meant for the field.
  ;; The geometry is the same arithmetic WM_CREATE uses.
  ;; How much of a combobox's window rect may claim a click.
  ;;
  ;; Our combobox is created at its full dropped height -- WordPad's font box is
  ;; 110x200 -- with the list as an inner child that is shown and hidden. So its
  ;; window rect covers a large part of the frame even while the list is closed,
  ;; and anything that hit-tests by window rect swallows clicks belonging to
  ;; whatever is drawn over that area. A menu popup is drawn over exactly that
  ;; area: WordPad's File menu drops at 7,40 180x284 and the font combo occupies
  ;; 6,74 110x200 underneath it, so making comboboxes hit-testable outside
  ;; dialogs stopped every menu item from responding. Closed, a combobox owns
  ;; its field and nothing more.
