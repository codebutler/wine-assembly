;; ---- PlaySound / sndPlaySound shared core --------------------------------
  ;; sndPlaySoundA, PlaySoundA and PlaySoundW all end up doing one thing: hand
  ;; a complete RIFF/WAVE image to $host_play_sound. They differ only in how
  ;; the caller *names* that image — a file on the VFS, a memory block it owns,
  ;; or a WAVE resource in the module — so each naming form resolves to a
  ;; (wasm address, byte length) pair here and they share one validator, one
  ;; flag decision and one playback call.

  ;; A blob is only worth handing to the host if it opens with the RIFF/WAVE
  ;; container header. Anything shorter than a minimal 44-byte canonical WAV,
  ;; or carrying a different fourcc, is a caller error that has to report FALSE
  ;; — never a silent success that leaves the app waiting for audio.
