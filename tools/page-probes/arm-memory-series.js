// Page probe: start a memory time series for a browser run, so "is it leaking?"
// is answered by a slope instead of by an opinion.
//
// Pass as --before-load to tools/profile-web-frames.js and read it back with
// tools/page-probes/read-memory-series.js as --report-eval. It samples every
// SAMPLE_MS from the moment the page script runs, so the series covers app
// load as well as steady state -- a leak that only shows during load is
// invisible to a sampler armed after launch.
//
// WHAT IS SAMPLED AND WHY EACH ONE IS HERE:
//   wasmBytes  the guest's linear memory. FIXED at launch -- the import says
//              (memory 8192 16384 shared) but host.js creates it with
//              initial === maximum, so it never grows: 512MB, or 1GB for an
//              app with bigMemory set in lib/apps.js. It is here as the
//              denominator and to catch a second instance being launched, NOT
//              as a leak signal; virtualTop below is the exhaustion signal.
//   jsHeap     performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize. Chrome only, and it is
//              quantised and lags real allocation, so read the trend across
//              many samples and never a single delta.
//   canvases   document.querySelectorAll('canvas').length. A per-window
//              back-canvas that is never released shows up here long before
//              it shows up in the heap number, because the bitmap lives off
//              the JS heap.
//   apps       runningApps.length, to attribute a step change to a launch.
//
// runningApps is a MODULE-SCOPE binding in host.js, not a property of
// globalThis, so it can only be reached by bare name and only inside a
// try/catch -- referencing it before host.js has run is a ReferenceError that
// would kill the sampler on its first tick.
