// --- The general port-poll spin ----------------------------------------------
//
// in_*_pspin collapses exactly one shape, `in al,dx / alu al,imm / jcc head`.
// The corpus polls 3DAh in several more, and they are where retrace-paced demos
// spend their time: `mov dx,3DAh` inside the loop (BTW, alpha), `and al,8 /
// cmp al,8 / jnz` (DIESEL), `in / jmp $+2 / test al,8 / jz` across two blocks
// (XMAS). One fused twin per shape does not scale, so this proves the property
// the twin needs instead and puts in_8_gspin (emit.js) on the `in`.
//
// The property: a PASS round the loop is a function of the 3DAh status it
// reads, and nothing else. Three things make that true.
//
//  1. Pure ops. Registers and flags only -- no memory, stack, segment write,
//     port, FPU or CX-counting op, every register index resolved
//     (handler-effects.js), and a known step charge.
//  2. No carried state. Starting from SOME op of the loop, every register byte
//     it reads is either never written in the loop or written earlier in the
//     same pass, and every flag read is preceded by an op that writes all the
//     flags. So a counter -- `inc cx` -- declines, and `mov dx,3DAh` in front
//     of the `in` does not.
//  3. The only way back at exactly one pass's cost is round the loop. The
//     twin's arm matches on "one pass of steps since this site read", and an
//     exit edge followed by other code could in principle come back to the
//     `in` at the same count -- BABYTRO's `jz out / jmp head` would tie with an
//     `out: ret` that returned to the head. So from each exit's target the
//     compiled code is searched, by exact step count, for any route that
//     reaches the `in` at the cost the loop itself takes from that exit. A
//     route the search cannot follow (a return, an indirect jump, an edge out
//     of this compile, an op with no fixed charge) counts as a tie if it is
//     taken within that cost, because it could land anywhere. A handback ends
//     the slice, and run() clears the arm, so it ends a route harmlessly.
//
// The walk follows the arena edges (TAKEN_AT, and a branch's operand tail says
// which kind it is: 2 words for a jump, 3 for a traced branch, 4 for a plain
// one). Straight-line flow into the next block start is only a traced
// branch's fall-through; anything else there is a handback, and ends it.
