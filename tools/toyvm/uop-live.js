// The µop tier in a live run (run-dos.js `uop`, CLI `--uop`).

//            program-counter samples, exactly as run-dos's `sample` takes
//            them, attributed to blocks with trace-jit.js rankSamples.
//   PICK     the hottest blocks (up to `top`, each at least `minShare` of the
//            samples) become µop program heads: uop-ir discover from the
//            guest's CURRENT bytes, uop-opt build, lowered and encoded for E1.
//   INSTALL  the head goes into CodeCache.uopHeads, which the compiler leaves
//            as a handback (compile.js `handbackAt`), and the compiled
//            code that holds it is made to hand back there (hold). The
//            program keeps a copy of the bytes it was built from.
//   RUN      DosSession.step asks `at()` at every handback; standing at a live
//            head, the program runs the slice with the slice's own budget and
//            hands the machine back wherever it exits. Its bytes carry code
//            bits only for the length of the run (guard/unguard).
//
// No wasm is generated: E1's module depends on the engine's op table alone and
// is instantiated once before the run starts; a program is data written into
// the engine page. A program whose bytes no longer match its copy is rebuilt
// from the new bytes the next time the guest stands at its head --
// up to `maxRebuilds`, after which the head goes back to the compiled path.
