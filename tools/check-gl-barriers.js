// Gate: every GL entry point whose answer the guest can read on its next
// instruction is a command-stream barrier.
//
// lib/gl-command-stream.js buffers GL calls into a batch and submits the batch
// later. That is correct for state and geometry, whose only observable effect
// is on the screen, and wrong for anything that writes guest memory or returns
// a value: the guest runs on, reads the destination, and sees whatever was
// there before the call. Nothing reports this. The call was made, the host
// answered it correctly, the answer simply had not arrived yet.
//
// Warcraft III is the case that cost a day. It asks
// glGetIntegerv(GL_MAX_TEXTURE_UNITS_ARB) and copies the answer into its
// renderer three instructions later. Buffered, the copy read the zero that was
// already there, the renderer concluded it had no texture units, and it never
// called glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D) again -- every polygon in the game drew
// untextured, with no error anywhere to say a query had been answered late
// rather than wrongly.
//
// So the rule is enforced by shape rather than by memory: an opcode whose name
// says it reports something (glGet*, glIs*, glGen*, glReadPixels) or that
// crosses the WGL boundary must be in BARRIERS. Two names match the shape and
// genuinely do not need it, and each has to say why here.
//
// Usage: node tools/check-gl-barriers.js
