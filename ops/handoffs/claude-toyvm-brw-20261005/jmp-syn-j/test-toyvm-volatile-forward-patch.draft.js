// A STORE INTO AN INSTRUCTION AHEAD OF IT, IN THE SAME STRAIGHT LINE, MUST BE
// SEEN BY THAT INSTRUCTION -- also once its paragraph has gone volatile.
//
// dos-loop.js compiles a paragraph that has taken VOLATILE_AFTER self-modify
// breaks uncached, once per entry, and when that program has no loop and no
// call it takes the code bits DOWN ("pure"), on the assumption that "a
// straight line that never comes back has nothing to protect: its stores land
// behind the program counter". A forward patch breaks that: the decoder has
// already baked the old byte into the words for the instruction ahead, the
// store raises nothing because the bits are down, and the stale byte runs.
//
// BRW.EXE (toyvm long-run fixture) is the witness: its texture-span routine
// (8:c179..c37x) writes the immediates of the inner loop it is about to run,
// and from 330,588,088 the interpreter ran those spans with the previous
// span's immediates while a region-JIT arm (whose installs moved the block
// starts) took the breaks and computed what an x86 computes. See
// ops/handoffs/claude-toyvm-brw-20261005/jmp-syn-j/v4-vol-20261005/summary.md.
//
// The program: SUB stores AL into the imm8 of `add dl, imm8` two bytes ahead
// and returns. It is entered fresh every call, so a volatile compile of it is
// a straight line to `ret` with no back edge and no call -- the pure path.
// The caller passes AL = 1..N and the correct DL is their sum; a stale imm8
// adds the PREVIOUS call's value instead. The early calls take breaks (the
// bits are up), which is what promotes the paragraph; the assertion is about
// the calls after that.
//
// Expected to FAIL on HEAD (2683a6e3) and to pass once the pure path keeps the
// bits of bytes a forward store can reach. Draft: not yet run.
