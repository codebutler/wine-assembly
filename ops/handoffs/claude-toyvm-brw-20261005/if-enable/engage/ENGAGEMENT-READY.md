# IF-enable candidate: engagement gate, staged, NOT run

Prepared 2026-10-05T21:02:24Z (commit `eeae1755`); revised 2026-10-05T21:06Z for the supervisor hardening of `run-fixture.js` asked by root's source review. Source-only. It runs only on an explicit root grant, with a fresh board CLAIM / SESSION / RELEASE.

**Why this gate is next:**
- Correctness is complete for the 15 default tests: all PASS in both trees. See main `e6b09f57` + `2eb59bc6` (combined run) and `a1bb5034` + `3a51afa3` (replay).
- In every fixture run so far, the region JIT and tree-fold **never engaged**: 0 installs and 0 folds. So the candidate's IF semantics have only been shown while L1, uop and uop-only actually executed.
- A performance number before engagement would price code that never ran.

**Goal:** apply the two source-predicted fixes (NEXT-GATES-PLAN.md section 1, `predicted-engagement-fixes.diff`) and observe whether the region JIT and tree-fold install AND execute on the fixture. Every correctness assertion is re-checked on every arm while they do.

The trees are base `2683a6e3` + the pinned stack (v2v3j `54de1b13`, v4 `4b00d26d`, smc `b3371e21`). For `cand`, `ee8265ba` is added on top. Main's `69c1371b` fix is separate and in neither tree.

## Fixture changes against `e19398b3` (all in the test file; the candidate is untouched)

1. **Region arm:** adds `--step-audit`. It only reads the region JIT's step counters at the end of the run (run-dos.js ~1582), giving executed evidence: "regions charged N steps for M instruction weights".
2. **Fold arm:** adds `--tree-fold-warm=1m --tree-fold-batch=1`, the predicted fix.
   - The profile window otherwise closes at 10M dispatches, after these programs have already exited at ~4.2–4.8M.
   - `batch=1` installs the first wanted tree at once, as `test-toyvm-tree-fold.js` does.
3. **New `foldStats` arm:** the same fold flags plus `--tree-fold-stats=1m`. Its payoff rows carry per-tree **entry** counts, which is the executed evidence.
   - It is a separate arm because the flag forces the per-handler histogram on (run-dos.js ~393). If that changed anything, the parity check on this arm alone would show it.
   - The payoff prints only if the second window closes before exit (tree-fold.js `payoffReport` ~1244). Install at ~1M + 250k skip + 1M closes at ~2.3M.
4. **`work` loop:** gains `mov [0x400],ax` (A3 00 04), the predicted region fix. The block then writes memory, so `extendThrough` does not trace the `jnz`, and `ret` leaves the loop block.
   - A new assertion refuses a program whose end would reach 0x400.
5. **Engagement parsing and tally:** the region and foldStats arms report executed evidence. After the cases, `ENGAGEMENT <arm>: installed in a/b [...]; executed evidence in c/b [...]` is printed per arm.
   - It is reported, never failed: the exit code remains correctness only.

## Wrapper hardening (`run-fixture.js`, root review)

The same semantics as the reviewed `run-toyvm-tests.js` / `bench-trees.js`:
- `--total` must be finite seconds > 0 and `--plan` non-empty. Both are checked before `--out` exists or any child starts; otherwise exit 2.
- A spawn failure is recorded as `spawnError` and classified HARNESS-FAIL. It no longer leaves the step hanging with no listener.
- When a child closes, its whole process group is SIGKILLed, and `leftoverGroup` records whether anything was still there. An early-exiting child can no longer leave a live grandchild, and the child's own exit/status is kept.
- Each step settles exactly once.
- Test hook: `--node=<exe>`.

**Classification is unchanged:** PASS / ARCH-FAIL / HARNESS-FAIL from the test's exit code and its `FAIL` lines. The fixture's `ENGAGEMENT …` tally lines are observation only, and they never make a step pass or fail.

**`run-fixture.test.js`:** 6/6, with no emulator. The real wrapper runs beside a fake `build-tree.js` and fake fixture:
- PASS / ARCH-FAIL with ENGAGEMENT lines that must not count as a verdict;
- an early exit leaving a live grandchild: status kept, group reaped, grandchild dead;
- a spawn error: `spawnError` ENOENT, HARNESS-FAIL, no tree left;
- the total bound killing a hung test and its grandchild;
- invalid `--total` (0, -1, abc, Infinity, NaN) and an empty `--plan` refused before `--out`, while a valid `--total=300` is accepted;
- a non-empty `--out` refused.

**Against the unhardened `d86f384c`:** the same tests give 2/6. Its early-exit run left both grandchildren alive; they were found afterwards and killed. Its spawn-error case fails because it has no `--node` hook, so that case alone does not prove the old behaviour.

## Static verification done (no emulator)

- **`--emit` byte comparison against the coverage2 fixture:** this assembles the programs only.
  - 7 of the 8 programs are byte-identical, with every label address unchanged.
  - `region_coexist` differs only by the 3 inserted bytes at offset 79 (92 → 95 B, ending at 0x15f, well under 0x400).
- **`engagement-parser-check.js`:** 10/10. It renders run-dos.js's **own** step-audit statement and payoff formatter at `2683a6e3` with stub values, then runs the fixture's own parser over them:
  - charged steps > 0 reads as executed, and 0 reads as not executed;
  - a missing line reads as "no report", never as executed;
  - the payoff entry sum works;
  - the plain fold arm reports installed only.
- `node --check` passes.

## Command (after GRANT)

```sh
cd /home/user/wine-assembly/scratch/claude-toyvm-brw-v2-review-20261005/ifen-pinned-engage
STAMP=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
setsid node run-fixture.js --out=/home/user/wine-assembly/scratch/runs/claude-toyvm-if-engage-$STAMP \
  --plan=cand,stack --total=300 \
  --candidate=$PWD/impl-draft/candidate-v2.diff \
  --candidate-sha=ee8265ba3302fa10c439e1b6e7328fd92b41878ed95e6a54df9a99b65f5f8ba4 \
  > ../engage-$STAMP.console.txt 2>&1 < /dev/null &
# wrapper PID: from `ps -eo pid,pgid,args | grep run-fixture` (setsid forks; $! is not it)
```

**Bounds:**
- 300 s in total, and each test gets `min(140, what is left)`. Each child runs in its own process group and is killed with its descendants at the bound.
- **Expected:** coverage2 took 23 s per tree with 5 arms. With 6 arms and a histogram on one of them, about 30–45 s per tree is expected; this is an estimate only.

## How to read the result

**Correctness** is the same as coverage2: [0] exited, [1] ≥7 deliveries at X, [2] none in a shadow, [3] the same (dispatch, ip) sequence as l1. It is now checked on 6 arms.
- **cand:** expected PASS on the counted cases.
- **stack:** expected ARCH-FAIL, as before. The stack is the contrast tree, not a baseline the candidate must match.

**Engagement** is the gate's question:

| outcome | meaning |
|---|---|
| region installed and executed in `region_coexist`, cand PASS | the predicted region fix works, and the candidate's semantics held while region code ran in that program |
| fold installed in a case, and foldStats executed (entries > 0), cand PASS | the same for tree-fold |
| `sti_in_loop` region: not installed, with a "contains sti" decline in its rejects | the candidate's decline seen in practice, which is expected |
| any arm still 0 installs | the prediction failed: read its `--why` / decline lines; that is a source finding, not a candidate defect |

**What it still cannot show:** an IRQ falling due **at a boundary inside compiled code**. `region_coexist` keeps the IF-enable boundary outside `work`, and the candidate declines regions containing sti/popf/jmp_ifen. "Region code executed in a program whose IF assertions held" is the claim, and nothing more. Boundary execution stays open.

**Out of scope:** benchmark, disassembly and promotion. No change to the candidate or to any shipped test.

**Pre-flight / post-flight:** the same as the replay.
- **Before:** record `df`, `pgrep -a node` and `ls -d /tmp/toyvm-ifen-*`.
- **After:**
  - the trees have been removed and no children remain;
  - every PID is reported;
  - the console and per-step logs are kept unchanged.
