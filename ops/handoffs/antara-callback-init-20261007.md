# Antara original callback and resource outcome, 2026-10-07

Task: `NEW-GAME-BETRAYAL-ANTARA-DEMO-20261006`. This is an intermediate causal checkpoint, not a gameplay qualification or implemented fix.

The ordinary original SETUP launch uses source `096889e174488a97529b8e73076d3a1e2feb2345` and module SHA-256 `fb1be916c309bf619a9331c8fd46c4319f9051af76b05b236d3c362bb632638f`. The original recovered `_SETUP.EXE` SHA-256 is `a11e70704b15c12424e771a1b7c331396f69644d7cb1f53a7a5b3999f9309bb4`. No guest byte, callback return, API outcome, artificial control or input was changed. A private Worker and receipt-only WorkerLink observed the actual owning child.

## Measured callback path

Original caller NE segment 2:313a passes dialog procedure 2:2ca0. The actual USER87 `dialog_loaded` import arms before initialization, with child tid 2, HWND 98306 / Win16 HWND `0117`, parent 98305, procedure `0047:2ca0`, segment base `170000` and limit 55093. The original procedure receives `WM_INITDIALOG` (`0110`), wParam/lParam zero, resolves object `0087:655a`, and dispatches vtable slot `+70h` to actual `004f:d530`. The callback then installs ordinary subclass `0047:12f2` via USER136. That adapter's ordinary dispatch slot `+58h` enters actual `0047:1c2e` for window-position and move messages.

All 86 captured callback blocks and four virtual entries match original code outside the exact original relocation operand spans. The comparison records each relocated byte and its original relocation entry; it does not independently prove every resolved relocation target. The scalar stream contains 100 complete frames / 1060 values with no unknown marker, partial frame or observer error. The capture ends at the 512-hook-arrival bound before WM_PAINT; no paint dispatch observation is claimed. The original zero-item dialog resource remains insufficient evidence for missing controls.

## Measured resource failure

KERNEL60 `FindResource`, hInstance `0110`, type 2, far name `0057:317c` resolving id 164, returns resource handle `0118`. KERNEL61 `LoadResource` with that handle/instance returns AX zero at EIP `1a3ef6`. KERNEL62 `LockResource(0)` returns DX:AX `0000:0000`; GDI442 `CreateDIBitmap` receives null bitmap data and returns zero.

Original recovered `SOL_ENG.DLL` SHA-256 `22f02bb8ee3adbe997b87bff3409492effb35baa0453d39e78104002cf33a375` has bitmap 164 at file offset 101216, length 308272, bitmap SHA-256 `0b04090ffa3c9c4decd15a3ffe55afde3e0509786eb198b8a63014b24d5afc6b`. Its 40-byte header specifies 640x480 / 8 bpp. These original bytes exist, but their runtime file-open/read or allocation cause has not been observed.

Source `win16_res_load` reopens dynamic modules to read resources because only their 64 KiB metadata image is retained. `win16_res_module_path` synthesizes `C:\NAME.DLL`, whereas `VfsSeed.residentWin16Module` can stage a module from another VFS directory and returns its actual path. Host staging currently discards that path. This is a hypothesis requiring the next actual LoadResource import observation, not a proven fix. Copying from the metadata image would be invalid for this bitmap.

## Durable evidence and cleanup

`scratch/runs/20261007T222523Z-antara-callback-init/artifact-index.json` was published last and indexes 570 hashed contained artifacts (~90 MB), including full 509-pin runtime closure, exact module/source/original 23 media files, recovered original EXE, helper scripts, logs, contexts and four screenshots. `analysis.json` records measured outcomes and limits. The personally reviewed `evidence/callback-settled.png` is the empty gray 640x480 Main Menu; there were no inputs, installation completion, game launch, gameplay, FPS or audio claims.

Remote box `bx_d8nw3e8t`: driver PID 108732 / Chrome PID 108744 launched 22:25:23 UTC, cleanup finished 22:26:22.851 with browser/server closed, zero cleanup errors, zero pending streams and Chrome exit 0. Independent terminal verification at 22:28:32 found both PIDs absent, no Chrome or owned sockets. After durable publication, owned remote prefix was removed and the lease released at 22:29:17. No local browser or native build ran.

Next prepared source-only diagnostic (`scratch/antara-resource-outcomes-20261007`) observes bounded actual resource file paths/results/read counts and activates callback block tracing only after a validated full WM_PAINT delivery frame. Pure JS observer, framing and real private Worker init/slice/stop-RPC integration checks pass. Its runtime execution awaits the explicit remote slot grant; no production fix or regression acceptance is claimed yet.
