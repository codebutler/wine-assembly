# Orchestrator status

## Current persistent-box checkpoint (2026-10-04)

Coordinator: codex:01a0ff91-cf9d-7f42-ba93-f9e7616b35a5, /root in wine-orchestrator. Core migration hold released by migration-core-ready-20261003.md. Approved launch UX complete and reviewed; source pushed5a381fd2, no public game deployment. Root browser/server work is closed; no canonical build or benchmark running for this task. Claude1863d2b5 released implementation at00:40:22; ops-dashboard owns its persistent terminal migration and bulk fixture restore. Exact review receipts: launch-ux-coordinator-review-20261004.md. Existing REP automatic-review restriction and audio/gameplay blockers remain.

## Historical pre-migration checkpoint

- Session: `codex:01a0f9d8-c0cd-73b3-a357-fb3ff1c784c0` (`/root`).
- tmux: `wine-orchestrator` (inherited TMUX socket confirms tmux launch).
- Startup registration: 2026-10-01T23:44:20Z.
- Last reviewed: 2026-10-02T06:48:24.399846+00:00.
- Phase: in-scope Codex migration reconciled: eight owner-authored root handoffs plus one reconstructed Codex handoff accepted. Five Claude roots deferred under updated orchestration scope. Executing ready tasks.
- Ownership: this status file and current coordinated section of `TODOS.md`.
- Board watcher: exec session 69315. Board is append-only.
- Policy: at most three workers; no mass staging, cleanup, process termination,
  deployment, or overlapping canonical builds. Existing dirty work preserved.
- REP validation interruption: worker turn ended with an automated cybersecurity-risk flag during the final optimized-path fixture step. No retry of that blocked execution is assigned. Completed matrices/regressions remain valid evidence. Corrected uop log records PASS with2entries/1COPYdeopt, but tool33835 exit is unconfirmed. ContinueSearch, direct MOVS code-write review and final static checks remain unfinished. Documentation-only handoff requested; no promotion or commit.
- Product decisions needed: none for current independent work. FP transfer/results completed; REP automated review gate remains. No old-session wakeup requested.
- FP kernel approval resolved: transfer, three pairs and result download completed; nine output hashes verified and all own jobs terminal. No new tool approval pending at this checkpoint.
- Dashboard task-writing integration is being added by the ops owner. Future `TODOS.md` edits will acquire `scratch/ops-task-write.lock`, reread under the lock and follow the owner's documented atomic-write protocol.

## Received and acknowledged

## Deferred Claude ownership

Do not interpret process inactivity as release. Inventory session IDs are in
`initial-inventory.md`.

- NFS2 / IS3 PID1433: private verification and media-import test now PASS, icons/IS3 hunks committed dd530167/b6db60d2; canonical build/browser released. Final durable root handoff and child/process accounting still pending.
- Older Claude roots PID10341,36638,68796,53759: deferred; no owner acknowledgment or takeover. Historical work is not queued automatically.

The updated `ops/ORCHESTRATOR.md` records user steering to defer these five
Claude roots and recover the remaining Codex history from files. No session
wakeup is requested. Preserve Claude files/jobs; missing ACK is not a Codex
work blocker. A future overlapping assignment still needs specific ownership
and resource reconciliation.

## Resource ledger

- Canonical build: IS3 child released at23:54:03Z after PASS (1654353bytes); final root handoff still pending. No coordinator build scheduled.
- Local CPU: all SAM visual runs, audio suites/build and ARM64 captures terminal. MIG-SAM-TIMER six suites/static gates and private intro replay PASS, own8147 stopped. Pirates route stopped before transfer; root process check confirms owned browser/helper/profile gone. Both REP baselines are semantic reds with recorded PC/progress/access-kind errors. REP execution stopped at automated review; no further local CPU assignment. Corrected test33835 log ends PASS but tool exit is unconfirmed; retain its state and watcher33192. Preserve8159. No timing work.
- Browser: preserve all existing profiles and services; no global cleanup.
- Serious Sam8138/8146: parked reference sessions, coordinator custody, no stepping/quit assigned.
- Ops8098: owner completed CPU/RSS, backfill and grouped task queue; latest12unit tests+browser/live checks PASS, latest reload exec7087. Unicode fix active. Task pictures/corpus ranking and conservative association fix committed a743b235; 147 uncertain historical bundles quarantined with evidence preserved. JavaScript-only tmux terminal and task navigation committed a1982973 in twelve owned paths; claim released and service exec7087 preserved. Live orchestrator received no test input. Preserve service and historical artifacts.
- ASCII bx_4r5uzdwv: six x64 structural captures complete and reviewed. MW3 assets restored/hash verified and originalP cockpit/3windows PASS;23artifacts verified, own processes cleaned. All three kernel pairs finished with correctness PASS and inconclusive timing; nine downloaded hashes verified,115inputs unchanged, own jobs stopped and slot released. Preserve frozen host. CDP SwiftShader overrides contradictory endpointIntel string, no hardware timing claim.
- fast-near-9tb-2: MMX durable scoped-job audit received; no coordinator assignment, other owners still require preflight.
- fast-near-9tb-1: Registry9/9 and Q2 scripted-key framechange checks complete, own jobs cleaned; remote slot released. Preserve Xvfb28507/unrelatednode3155733. Eleven registry files plus approved twelfth fixture staged with backups;144 protected source/compiler/module/fix hashes unchanged. WAT fa0cb8a8bc80cdb1837ca32b2da00616f6ad6de2b0cbb237f4fe51235751cc22 remains.

## Bounded workers

- `codex:01a0f9db-4a5d-7733-ade9-8b71d8e3f05f`: RENDER-SHARED-AUDIT complete;146 sampled main/private paths verified unchanged. OPS-COORDINATOR-CONTINUITY implementation released;10 fixture tests PASS. Root live busy scan51 notices and2 exact acknowledgements persisted across restart,49 remain pending. Natural Zuma handoff change delivered and both versions explicitly acknowledged;4 total acknowledgements, other pending preserved. Boundary polling integrated; task complete, no wake/terminal/model control.
- `codex:01a0f9db-89c0-73b3-b528-fe8bf239e061`: EXE-FAILURE-TRIAGE complete;167run hashes verified and findings linked to existing tasks. Zuma attempts1/2 ended in missing-dependency harness errors before guest, with no images; attempt3 reached reviewed640x480 title/loading on c474288d without historical missing API. Planned60s/4290batches exit0,6084 hashes stable; startup task complete, menu/gameplay unverified. CPU released; no further run.
- `codex:01a0f9db-07f4-71d2-9fe8-42d5efc7f642`: NFS3 isolated harness revision2 reviewed; bounded final captures and primary/front slot telemetry fixed and pure tests PASS. No browser or timing grant. Dashboard owner holds active local browser review; release requested on board.
- Root: handoff-follow-through completed, six missing follow-ups recorded; reviewing active worker deliverables and maintaining native goal/queue reconciliation. Existing board watcher69315 was polled and confirmed live.

## Completed evidence

- Ops Unicode fix verified9/9 and activated by owner reload. Initial ops/queue snapshot committed9b4f9b3f by separately user-authorized owner.
- PCP parity400sequences/14834ops PASS;264existing file hashes unchanged.
- Renderer fixed72 and actual shared-worker WebGL/native software PASS with narrow fog fix and guest-negative coverage; see mig-render-validation.md.
- SAM405db/363d paired87000/90000 PNGs, snapshots and captured GL state identical, hosts unchanged. Dark87000 resolves to brightGODGAMES90000; no gameplay claim. Both new runs stopped, references untouched.
- FP each architecture six captures/30function records verified; x64 downloads121hashes match, ARM64 inputs10unchanged/output120hashes recorded. Countdown remains spilled; affected ARM64Ion fastframes shrink16B. Version differences explicit, no timing claim.
- Registry: all nine correctness gates passed with 144 protected files unchanged. Q2 rendered its world and passed the scripted-key frame-change check; physical traversal remains unproven. See `mig-render-textures-validation.md` and `mig-render-q2.md`.
- Timer context: six suites and structural gates passed. Private module `0c5d6ab0` matched prior intro images/state at both checkpoints; remaining fault/REP transforms are still diagnostic. See `mig-sam-timer.md` and `mig-sam-timer-replay.md`.
- MW3 P: exact missing assets restored; cockpit and three diagnostic windows passed. All 23 downloaded artifacts matched remote hashes. Actual CDP renderer is SwiftShader; no hardware performance claim. See `mig-fp-browser-baseline.md`.
- Audio920ABI/input/full isolatedbuildPASS; primaryda5bf93b and compatea059e83 preserved. Committedcd50cfdf only4ownedpaths, staged source byte-identical to tested isolated9b4f9b3f+slice. Foreign timer hunk remains. See mig-audio-caps.md.

No worker may edit this ledger or `TODOS.md`; existing services/jobs preserved.

## Next action

Review worker recipes and allocate isolated correctness/benchmark resources before
execution. Original Codex disposition audit is complete. Validate natural-change delivery
and durable acknowledgement at every queue/handoff boundary under the active native goal. Acknowledge new requests and worker completions under the shared
queue lock. Backlog tasks stay unscheduled; REP automated review and deferred
Claude claims do not block independent work. Preserve existing services/jobs.

## Continuity integration checkpoint

Root uses the existing active native goal for subsequent turns. At each queue/handoff boundary, obtain fresh goal evidence and poll `ops/coordinator-inbox.js` with truthful current runtime state (busy during this turn); unknown connection/approval state withholds delivery. The durable cursor is `scratch/ops-coordinator-inbox.json`. Exact-ID acknowledgement records review only, never task completion or resource release. No daemon, terminal input or second coordinator was created. See `ops/handoffs/coordinator-continuity.md`.

Root independently reviewed the final Zuma PNG and terminal execution record. Historical visuals manifest snapshot20472f24 currently lists11 distinct images/candidates; all11 source hashes match. This is read-only preliminary verification, not acceptance of the external owner's still-pending recovery/coverage handoff. NFS3 remains unlaunched pending that owner's explicit browser/GPU resource release and fresh quiet-host preflight.

## Current continuation checkpoint — 2026-10-02T04:35:51.181483+00:00

The native goal resumed root after the previous completed turn without a new manual user prompt. Fresh inbox polling retained pending observations and found no new ready task beyond the already-owned historical recovery. The external dashboard owner is now explicitly recorded on that task. Fresh process inspection confirms root31655 and ops service84742 live; the earlier named browser-review script is absent, which is not an ownership release. Browser/GPU release and recovery handoff were requested again on the append-only board.

ops_review is auditing NFS3 static private runtime closure (no guest/browser/build/network), preserving2826 prior inputs and documenting any additions. Other two workers are idle; no overlapping work was assigned. No NFS3 timing or gameplay claim. Backlog remains unscheduled.

## Resource release and resumed work — 2026-10-02T04:38:09.066076+00:00

The dashboard owner explicitly released all owned browser/CPU/GPU review jobs on the board and published ops-visual-coverage.md. Keep8098/PID84742. The previous resource wait is resolved; ops_review now finishes static closure and performs three10s CPU-idle/memory preflights before root grants a single Glide qualification. No browser or timing launch yet.

Historical recovery remains active under root coordination. fp_parity audits the11 newly recovered captures and76-candidate coverage. serious_review audits147 quarantined bundles in a separate read-only report. No overlapping imports/source edits; both preserve original evidence and unknown associations. Coverage currently30of76, with46 unlinked rather than proved absent.

## Host contention and evidence corrections — 2026-10-02T04:43:58.557330+00:00

NFS3 closure is complete:12270 regular files,9442 additions, prior2826 inputs plus prepared helper identities preserved. Resource preflight43088 exited0 but failed quiet-host gate (31.46/28.53/35.40percent idle against95). Existing replayd/WindowServer/WebKit/Chrome observed as contenders; no signal or browser launch. Worker released handles. NFS3 task is blocked until a meaningful capacity change and fresh preflight. Dashboard subsequently released its short GPU-disabled UI review, but that does not establish quietness or release unrelated workloads.

fp_parity accepted11 image hashes/classifications and coverage30of76, then received a narrow metadata-correction grant for ops/historical-visuals.json, ops/recover-visuals.js and four recovered bundles only. NFS2/Heroes exact-command language is unsupported by linked provenance; GTA2 has a source-reported historical hash; Alien Shooter needs its direct citation. Screenshots/originals/unknown outcomes stay unchanged. serious_review continues the147-bundle quarantine audit. ops-dashboard independently claimed corpus-status.md/UI presentation; no overlapping quarantine work or benchmark launches.

## Historical audit accepted; publication ownership transferred — 2026-10-02T04:50:05.835062+00:00

All three workers released owned handles. Historical metadata corrections changed9authorized files,8disposable fixture cases passed,49of58 protected inputs remained byte/mtime-identical and remaining9were authorized metadata changes. All11source/published PNGs and historical timestamp/unknown-outcome invariants preserved. Shared manifest already contained a foreign twelfth Ricochet entry; it was preserved. Overlapping dashboard claim was reconciled by pausing worker writes and explicitly handing all recovery metadata/importer files to dashboard owner; no further worker writes.

147quarantine rows complete: original audit8confident/5incorrect/134unresolved,441files and147source hashes unchanged. Root exact-cited Codex records530/608 resolve NFS2 command association, giving combined9/5/133; original audit snapshot retained. Six Ricochet frames and one corrected NFS3 association have explicit source evidence; copies/imports remain dashboard-owned. User-facing task stays active until integration and final coverage/disposition links are verified. External corpus-status report/UI work remains separately owner-claimed. NFS3 resource block remains; no new preflight or launch without changed contention.

## New FPS request and completed dashboard integration — 2026-10-02T05:54:24.874436+00:00

Accepted OPS-GAME-FPS-BASELINE with owner ops_review. It selected original Ricochet Round1-1 and pinned364assets. Separate isolated qualification driver preparation granted against validated audio-base, cold-load caveat explicit; no runtime/source-substitution/build/upload grant. Measurement stays disabled until reviewed continuous gameplay-state guard. Dashboard schema uses counted guest presents, per-window raw intervals/p95 and actual renderer/host/build. First route does not complete other named candidates or hardware baseline.

Root SSH read-only resource check69238 exited0; saved scratch/ops-game-fps-remote-resource-20261002.json at05:50Z:4CPUs,~6.9GiBavailable,3x5s idle99.70/99.75/99.70,no scopedjobs. This suggests ASCII diagnostic capacity but is not the later3x10s launch preflight or hardwareGPU proof. NFS3 hardware requirement unchanged.

Ops-dashboard explicitly completed18 recovery images/NFS2proof/all6Ricochet/correctedNFS3 and released files/browser jobs; service8098 retained. fp_parity performs read-only final18-image/coverage/quarantine acceptance. serious_review idle. New Telegram bridge/server/terminal claim belongs only to external ops-dashboard owner; coordinator assigns no overlapping work.

## Historical acceptance and FPS semantics — 2026-10-02T06:48:24.399846+00:00

OPS-HISTORICAL-VISUALS marked complete after final18image/metadata review,522protected hashes unchanged,441quarantine files unchanged,9/5/133 disposition publication links verified. Remaining46unlinked/133uncertain evidence-only search recorded OPS-HISTORICAL-UNLINKED backlog. fp_parity released resources.

Ricochet driver is being prepared with measurement hard-disabled; continuous scene guard and primary lifecycle remain unproven. Independent frozen-source review found kind5 partial updates and duplicate public onGuestFrame callbacks; kind6 is accepted Flip submissions, not displayed/unique-content frames. NFS3 handoff records analogous software kind5 limitation before any future measurement. serious_review now audits exact archived collectors behind historical NFS3/GTA2 rates; initial evidence shows originating kind6 collectors, so public-callback duplication does not justify halving those numbers. Final report pending.

Root requested clarification of dashboard FPS hardware-only completion wording versus explicit hardware/SwiftShader labels in task Done criteria; preparation continues and no gate silently relaxed. No fresh runtime or performance sample has been produced.

## Labels accepted; single Ricochet qualification granted — 2026-10-02T08:36:52.198135+00:00

Root reviewed six-file narrow label patch and verified all six handoff hashes. Two historical rates/p95 unchanged, explicit guest-flip-events labels correct originating kind6 semantics. Focused two tests passed; service8098 remains owner-controlled and reload requested through board. No public callback correction factor applied.

Root reviewed final Ricochet driver/helper and accepted12637-file preparation. ops_review granted private transfer to new assigned ASCII directory, full hash verification, fresh3x10s>=95percent idle and4GiB preflight, then exactly one600sbody+20scleanup SwiftShader qualification. No measurement, retries, builds or hardware-completion claim. Foreign processes/runners preserved; artifacts and cleanup evidence required. Other two workers released their completed reports and remain idle.

## Lifecycle assessment accepted — 2026-10-02T08:42:13.411268+00:00

All seven reviewed input hashes match. ops-game-fps-lifecycle.md establishes current5/6 collector lacks allocation/free history and endpoint primary pointers cannot exclude reuse. test_dx_primary_entry may clear stale cached primary; prior strict read-only claim corrected. Color/hash scene gates remain candidate detectors, not continuous ball/round/lives/control proof. One granted frozen qualification unchanged; review concrete route/telemetry artifacts before further diagnostic or measurement. serious_review completed and released resources. ops_review remains active; no runtime result or remote transfer is yet confirmed by root.

## Next named-candidate preparation — 2026-10-02T08:46:49.249989+00:00

Ricochet qualification remains exclusively ops_review; current runtime/transfer result not yet reported. fp_parity assigned independent existing-evidence Jazz2/Collapse route comparison under same five-candidate FPS task, owning only ops-game-fps-next-route.md and scratch evidence. No browser/build/network grant. serious_review finished lifecycle assessment. Queue check found no new ready records or dashboard replies; backlog stays unscheduled and native goal active.

## Host preflight resumed; Collapse preparation assigned — 2026-10-02T08:55:42.221304+00:00

ops_review reports pinned SSH cell213 exit0, host box-node-5addbcc063118d49 x64 user1000,45GiBfree and no Node/Chrome jobs; existing Xorg/services retained. Initial approval wait resolved. Local packaging exec71366, no transfer/run confirmed yet. Root pane capture401 completed read-only; no approval accepted by root.

Next-route assessment accepted: root opened both historical Collapse images and verified score0to26, level1, blocks680to581.26protected evidence files unchanged per worker check. Jazz57assets match, but existing browser gate accepts attract. fp_parity now owns new isolated Collapse qualification-only fixture; serious_review owns independent frozen GDI counter assessment. Three workers active, only Ricochet has a conditional runtime grant.

## Collapse GDI counter assessment accepted — 2026-10-02T09:00:34.552840+00:00

Root reviewed ops-collapse-fps-frame-review.md and verified all seven frozen input identities. Originating gdi_surface_upload with create/attach/delete and observed top-level surface/rectangles supports explicitly labeled GDI presentation-submission rate. Canonical flushes coalesce and readback can cause them; do not use those as originating frame cadence. Nearby reviewed gameplay checkpoints plus stable stream/input schedule provide sampled-scene evidence, not displayed/unique frames or universal continuity proof. serious_review handed findings to fixture owner and released resources.

fp_parity identified incompatible frozen timer registration: audio-base discards EVENT_SET/PULSE bits. It is assessing exact source/module choice or narrow tested slice before binding Collapse to a runnable module. No build/source substitution granted yet. Ricochet transfer last reported active exec47907; no terminal/run result yet.

## Ricochet transfer complete; launch command pending — 2026-10-02T09:04:16.018892+00:00

Worker reports fixture transfer47907 exit0 and wrapper transfer87282 exit0. Single pinned SSH invocation of remote-qualify.py pending in functions cell224 require_escalated; no returned output or launch asserted. This exact pending operation verifies12637 files/manifest/links, fresh quiet and memory/process gates, then one bounded qualification. Root neither retries nor approves it through another channel. Normal command approval is the current wait; independent Collapse timer review/preparation continues.

Approval update 2026-10-02T09:05:07.553822+00:00: cell224 approved and yielded active SSH exec83398. Verification/quiet gates running; no launch asserted. Normal approval wait resolved. Collapse timer review flags unproven PULSE waiter delivery; exact game requirement and real SET wait coverage requested before build.

## First Ricochet qualification reviewed — 2026-10-02T09:07:12.162649+00:00

Wrapper83398 exit0 but driver1, PID/PGID254998. Root independently verified48artifact hashes, idle99.1246/99.4746/99.7748percent and7,219,756KiBavailable; thermalunknown. Final process snapshot noNode/Chrome. Module da5bf93b and served observer identities preserved. CDP Chrome151 actualSwiftShader. Root viewed round-1 and last: Round1-1 entrance animation,timer00:00:00,no full brick field; candidate color threshold is not ready-gameplay proof. Worker start timedout20s with404s/worker errors; fallbackcooperative triggered driver assertion before ball input/telemetry. No performance. Read-only frozen failure inspection assigned to sameowner; no retry granted.

Collapse static exact-byte directcall proves flags0x11 periodic EVENT_SET and auto-reset initiallynonsignaled event. This narrows required behavior; PULSE waiter semantics remain unproven. Three-function private slice awaits real SET waiter test recipe and review, no build yet.

## Concrete fixes assigned after evidence review — 2026-10-02T09:08:50.197199+00:00

Independent timer review accepted: three functions form self-contained SET prerequisite with no layout/REP/TLS/scheduler expansion. fp_parity granted new private audio-base copy and exact patch, real ThreadManager plus actual WAT SET tests (auto/manual,one-shot/periodic,peek/kill/coalescing,parked waiter cardinality/frame preservation), serial callback/next-due/structural checks. Full deployable build awaits dependency closure/test evidence; no canonical mutation or runtime. PULSE remains unqualified.

Ricochet diagnosis identifies custom guest-worker.js response lacks COEP/CORP because custom handler returns before static-server headers. This is concrete response defect and plausible startup cause, not yet runtime-proven attribution. ops_review granted separate v2 preparation with corrected headers, early backend failure, observed entrance rejection and request-error diagnostics; original fixture/artifacts immutable. Static/pure/isolatedHTTP checks only, no upload/rerun grant.

## Remaining routes reviewed; implementation tests in progress — 2026-10-02T11:12:46.719807+00:00

Accepted ops-game-fps-desktop-routes.md with 10 input hashes verified. GTA2 has normal Enter browser world entry but no reviewed movement; Unreal controlled headless single-player sequence is not yet translated to normal browser input. No additional runtime grant.

Ricochet preliminary v2 driver37f25b30/manifest712f6ecf passed static checks but unconditional entrance stop would prevent original controls/telemetry objective. Root requested bounded candidate discrimination against failed entrance and historical full-brick ready/launched/left/right references. Worker acknowledged; these v2 hashes are superseded preparation, no run.

Collapse SET fixture first compile produced f275204c3a3f51533ec17afaee917f9e720eba64804e8dd068291da77d59799d, session34189 exit1 due nonexistent test cleanup tm.closeHandle. No timer semantic conclusion beyond first-case assertions. Narrow test-only correction/rerun granted; exact production slice remains unchanged.

## Collapse SET integration test reviewed — 2026-10-02T11:34:27.681356+00:00

Corrected test-only closeSyncHandle API; production slice unchanged. SET fixture42701 exit0, same compiled test-module f275204c3a3f51533ec17afaee917f9e720eba64804e8dd068291da77d59799d. Root read full fixture and second log: actual WAT timer calls real frozen ThreadManager event state/wait resolution, four auto/manual and one-shot/periodic cases, two preparked cardinality cases, coalescing/peek/kill/frame checks. Final Worker dispatch is a spy; no browser/OS scheduling or PULSE claim. callback82444 reported exit0; next-deadline log PASS, worker terminal confirmation pending. Structural/build dependency review still in progress; full build not yet granted.

## V2 qualification and isolated build granted — 2026-10-02T11:38:20.226559+00:00

Root reviewed revised Ricochet3filepatch and8image calibration, opened ready3, verified driver16a4df17/helper49161d07/test4a672bb7 and manifest28c3a22e. Three complete-brick candidate observations retain original control/telemetry diagnostic path; measurementdisabled. ops_review granted ONE fresh private v2 remote qualification after complete hash/link/quiet checks; may clone verified original into separate tree, preserve firstattempt. No general retries.

Collapse final SET6cases,callback,next-due and3structural checks accepted; nextdue19702 confirmedexit0. Build closure138files204edges0external, sole./x miss explanatorycomment. Root reviewed frozen build script and granted ONE serial private fullbuild after minimal necessary newtest-manifest registration, backup oldprivate modules, preserve all originalbase/draft bytes. No canonical build/runtime, no bindingready until GDI driver review.

## Prebuild closure completion — 2026-10-02T12:10:08.154375+00:00

Frozen auto-discovery already registers new Collapse SET test; no manifest edit needed. Worker found missing fs-data input test/run-all.sh before starting fullbuild. Root authorized copying missing build data only from exact9b4f9b3f Git revision into private tree, with blob/byte identities pinned, and inspecting remaining fs-read dependencies. Existing frozen timeout JSON stays unchanged; no current helper substitution/gate bypass. Build still not claimed started.

Root reviewed Ricochetv2 remote wrapper diff (newpath/manifest/output only); required delta archive must preserve finalmanifest identity. Superseded prepare-v2.py recipe is historical, not authoritative current build. Owner asked to retain that distinction and report live operation. No duplicate remote command from root.

## Build data closure follow-up — 2026-10-02T12:29:07.908938+00:00

Root read isolated-build.log: required gates progressed through host signatures/browser versions, then toyvm bundle check reports missing docs/dos-corpus/live/toyvm-bundle.js and toyvm-jit-bundle.js. Owner asked to confirm terminal handle and preserve first log. Exact9b4f9b3f missing-file restoration and subsequent full required build authorized only after closure verification; no timer semantics/source change or gate bypass inferred. Root does not duplicate running owner operations. Ricochetv2 owner asked for current live handle/approval state; no new launch result asserted.

## Collapse final design accepted; GTA2 preparation assigned — 2026-10-02T19:09:25.754732+00:00

Root read final integration review and independently matched its eight identities.

serious_review released final review and now owns bounded GTA2 static fixture/normal-browser route preparation under OPS-GAME-FPS-BASELINE, exclusively scratch/ops-gta2-fps-20261002 and ops/handoffs/ops-gta2-fps-preparation.md.

NFS3 capacity handoff accepted: single approved ps terminal0, retained output truncated, current contention observed, no3x10s remeasurement or benchmark; old process disappearance unknown. No pending process approval remains.

Root read Jazz startup driver and verified six final identities; serious_review independently found60s observation race permitting late screenshot after an awaited snapshot, and missing actual guest window/exclusive viewport metadata. Corrections required before packaging; downstream full route remains disabled. Full closure pinning belongs in reviewed outer wrapper, not self-loaded manifest alone. Owner ops_review currently prioritizes Ricochet; reviewer owns separate review handoff only. GTA2/Unreal accepted packages still queued.

## Queue advance and conditional GTA2 grant — 2026-10-02T20:15:30.362076+00:00

Prior turn made progress: accepted Collapse release/125 root hashes, activated Ricochet grant, assigned independent Jazz deadline fix. Current continuation read saved geometry diagnosis (three images stable-label score1 at page40,195; no guest-coordinate transform inferred). fp_parity continues frozen-source geometry audit; no retry. Ricochet owner polled clone61713 terminal0 and is transferring exact reviewed delta/wrapper; no launch claimed.

Unreal remains later, no grant.

NFS3 task now cites completed readonlycapacity recheck and explicitly distinguishes historical interval failure/currentcontention/unknown oldPIDs; no additional load or hardware qualification.

## Execution approval and portable Jazz closure — 2026-10-02T20:16:25.441730+00:00

No approval answered/reissued/rerouted. Owner asked preserve samehandle and supply current transfer receipts. Root is relaying user action gate, not claiming runtime started.

Read independent Jazz startup review; correction owner continues bounded scope. Root independently enumerated250 fixturelinks:247 resolve contained, three unused dangling node_modules/.bin links(prebuild-install,rc,mkdirp), matching prior base. Not a portable250 resolvinglink claim. Original fixture/base preserved; future separate portable package must explicitly exclude3/pin247 (or prove needed closure), with externally pinned manifest/full inventory gate. No install/build/browser. NFS3 blocker was reconciled previously; no capacity resampling.

## Ricochet approved execution and Jazz correction review — 2026-10-02T20:18:21.963526+00:00

Native approval received for exact existing Ricochet command. Owner polled same cell321 and received live exec61906; delta60191/wrapper13092/clone61713 terminal0. Wrapper execution actual, not yet guest launch or successful preflight proof. No duplicate command.

Root reviewed current Jazz changes: closed/deadline scope checked before/after awaited snapshot/screenshot and before record; finally closes scope. Deferred snapshot and screenshot tests reject late continuation while preserving original timeout; metadata copies actual guest clientRects and exclusive viewport with lexical sharedRenderer. Static design accepted in principle, final tests/hashes/handoff awaited. No changes made by root to worker-owned fixture. Full gameplay remains disabled. Current continuation includes source review and verified active owner execution receipt, not a no-progress blocker turn.

## Jazz correction accepted; portable package assigned

Root verified six corrected release identities (driverfb2c9548/helper592fbe10/testb28f2734/manifestf22a9fd6/unchangedscene+module), read new deferred tests and source; owner5729 tests/syntaxPASS,64800 full12339+12270basePASS. Narrow correction accepted. fp_parity released completed Collapse mapping audit and assigned separate scratch/ops-jazz2-package-20261002 plus ops/handoffs/ops-jazz2-package.md for local portable wrapper/archive. Corrected source fixture immutable; copy excludes exactly3danglingbins/pins247containedlinks, externally pinned fullregularclosure/module/manifest gate beforedriver;650sownedgroup/resource/attempt/prepost pattern, archive readback and changedparameter tests. No network/build/browser/runtime grant. serious_review remains GTA2 conditionalnext. Root to review Collapse mapping proposal independently. Ricochet ownerfreshpoll61906 stilllive; no result/release inferred.

## User authorizes quiet remote software rendering

User Telegram explicitly directs remote ASCII/boat.dev machine for quiet CPU, notes noGPU, and permits software renderer or browser-emulatedGL. This supersedes waiting for localhardware for the software/emulated track; actualbackend must remain disclosed and no hardwarebaseline claim follows. NFS3 task reopened active with original threeguestpath/correctness/route/counter requirements retained. ops_review assigned separate local preparation roots after current Ricochet downloaded/hashverified/cleanup release; existing GTA2/Unreal/Jazz queue remains serialized. No new remote run overlaps current resource claim, no quietgate relaxation, no rawkind5 or browserrAF relabeling as gameplayFPS. Broader authorized measurements can proceed after actual playable route and counting semantics/methodology review.

## Package acceptance and telemetry review — 2026-10-02T21:19:37.222721+00:00

Previous status turn checked live approvals (none pending); current continuation delivers source review and ownership assignments. Unreal owner reports singletransfer68586 and full verification24354 terminal0; approved wrapper65578 active under existing one-attempt grant. No outcome or release inferred.

Collapse v2 release acknowledged: root read exact five-parameter wrapper diff, parameter/exclusive-attempt tests and receipt; independently rehashed archive0a2b59be/wrapper0fee8c2c/inventory5ec51730. Conditional ONE transfer/qualification granted ops_review only after fp_parity explicit Jazz terminal/downloaded-hashverified/clean-owned-residue/ASCII release. Full12300+247 identity, fresh3x10s95percent idle/4GiB/no competing runtime,650s owned group, exclusive attempt, posthash, native approvals and no retry retained. Root runtime visual review remains required.

Root read full NFS3 driver/helper/test. Diagnostic backend/route/deadline design retained, but windowEvidence validated stop without binding started/timeOrigin/armed/reset state to its arm snapshot; current test even reuses stop as arm. Released ownership assigned fp_parity for narrow helper/test correction and repinning, no packaging/runtime. Checkpoint before previously granted Jazz slot activation. ops_review independently reviews immutable Ricochet measurement source while root holds integration; no overlapping edits.


## Task ledger and pending status approval — 2026-10-02T21:21:57.710094+00:00

Shared task lock acquired and released normally for OPS-GAME-FPS-BASELINE and NFS3-RENDERER-BENCH. Removed stale GTA2-active/hardware-revision wording; recorded GTA2 accepted route, Unreal65578 last confirmed active, Jazz then Collapse serialized grants, Ricochet scoped-deadline correction and NFS3 arm-stop binding correction. Original five-game measurement and three-path NFS3 acceptance criteria remain intact.

Independent Ricochet review accepted actual-source duration weighting, pooled within-window nearest-rank p95, full lifecycle reset/identity and explicit sampled-scene limitations. ops_review now owns narrow absolute operation deadline checks before synchronous image/scene persistence, with fake-clock negatives and repinning; no package/runtime grant. Root additionally read measurement integration and strict scene thresholds; legitimate later brick loss may still reject, and root must inspect eight real checkpoints before metric acceptance.

Live dashboard approvals now shows native read-only Unreal status SSH request7a920fd6effcba891534db4e5b2e9fa77c89a4aff42d0b17 firstSeen21:17:42Z. User and owner informed; no approval answered, command duplicated or route changed. Pending observation does not establish test terminal or release. All three workers remain assigned, no new workers.


## Ricochet correction accepted and GTA2 coverage refined — 2026-10-02T21:25:02.019591+00:00

Root reviewed released absolute operation deadline, actual capture/checkpoint guards and deterministic synchronous-stall negatives; independently rehashed driver2cda1323/helper47215153/lifecycle109c0185/test5be8411b/manifest0535842e. ops_review granted local portable archive/wrapper in new scratch/ops-ricochet-measure-package-20261002 and dedicated handoff, immutable12647+247/module binding,650s owned group/exclusive attempt/full resource and artifact guards. No upload/runtime grant. Conditional Collapse after Jazz remains and preparation must checkpoint before activation.

Root raw GTA2 review proves matching two-context arm/stop and all retirements outside completed diagnostic window. Generic retirement ambiguities also fire during browser.close, and coverage uses mutable record references. Clarification saved root-counter-coverage-review.json and root-review.md. Actual remaining gap: allocation/free and selected-primary generation across shared-memory workers; empty second-worker Flip/present rows do not prove no lifecycle activity. No raw counts promoted or source/run changed.


## NFS3 corrected source accepted — 2026-10-02T21:26:50.482277+00:00

Root read exact helper/test correction and real installed-observer negatives, independently matched driver053e5054/helper07aa7237/test600ddc76/manifestc95191ea. Acceptance covers arm-stop state/identity/clock/origin/start/sequence matching and reset buffers; surface-lifetime and full-frame claims remain excluded. fp_parity granted local NEW scratch/nfs3-software-package-20261002 plus dedicated handoff, immutable12272inputs247links/module/overlays, firstGlide qualification-only command, full accepted650s/resource/attempt/artifact wrapper pattern and archive byte/link validation. No network/runtime grant; checkpoint preparation before conditional Jazz on actual Unreal release. Both task ledger entries reconciled using exclusive lock.

## Jazz transfer and counter-semantics follow-through — 2026-10-02T21:40:42.577688+00:00

Previous goal turn delivered offline audit code, not only status. Jazz owner reports pending setup approved, boardACK/claim executed, freshmkdir28282terminal0 and single upload65094active. No extraction/guestlaunch inferred. Current continuation accepts Unreal counter review with root raw tally/hash and asyncRPC/dirtyunion source confirmation:164sameclient uploads in5146.135ms are requests, not proven gameframes. ops_review assigned new localWinDrv/BitBlt attribution proposal/prototype, no runtime/build/network/largecopy.

Root read GTA2 observer draft and identified registered-worker ID duplicate/omission hole; owner instructed unique exactregistered/context sets and negative case before release. No singleworker gate relaxed without coverage. Offline Ricochet audit in scratch/ops-ricochet-root-audit-20261002 remains syntaxchecked, awaiting realbundle; preserves pendingvisualreview and nullperformance.


## GTA2 observer design accepted — 2026-10-02T21:43:46.603626+00:00

Root read final prototype including exact unique registered/context IDs, nonemptystring IDs and integernonnegative slots; negativecases cover duplicate/substituted/malformed matchingIDs and invalidslots.

## GTA2 integration acceptance and Jazz execution approval — 2026-10-02T21:55:40.878333+00:00

Corrected GTA2 source reviewed: before/after metadata diagnostics restored; available observed/arm/stop receipts survive interrupted collection as immutable copies without postdeadline requests. Seven focused tests PASS; root matched manifestfde739c4/binding5518ca2e/driver3645bd84/integration44780d69/observerf2dfe713/routea6f62191.

## GTA2 package acceptance and conditional queue extension — 2026-10-02T22:04:29.312908+00:00

Root independently matched archive6c8e502ceef51360a3be22bc5387a0bb4f642ec44c5260ccbb4280c0037751db (111726567 bytes), wrapper01a28c2d, inventory66554a01 and sourceReport03b460ca against released receipt. Prior wrapper delta/six focused checks reviewed; owner reports terminal78665, all12364 archive regular bytes+247 links verified and source12350 unchanged. Package accepted. serious_review ACK conditional ONE diagnostic qualification only after fp_parity NFS3 terminal/download-all-hashes/cleanup and explicit ASCII release to root/board/worker. No early transfer. Fresh destination and unchanged recipe/650s/95-percent idle/4GiB/exclusive attempt/fullpins/native approval/no retry guards apply. Root actual lifecycle/control review required; no FPS or atomic-lifetime proof implied. Queue Jazz->Collapsev2->Ricochet->NFS3->GTA2 lifecycle.

Live dashboard still presents Jazz native execution approval325847c4; no runstart inferred. Unreal integration has nine focused synthetic checks passing per owner; driver/closure wiring remains in progress. Previous user-status turn restated blockers, while this continuation completes package acceptance and assigns the next bounded runtime task.


## Unreal integration review — 2026-10-02T22:07:07.771386+00:00

Owner released first integration with eleven synthetic tests and full12392 inputs/247 links. Root read driver/observer/diff/tests and deferred acceptance for two concrete source-semantics gaps: synthetic WM_PAINT test reuses a GetDC association although actual WinDrv uses BeginPaint; successful SelectObject updates the tracked bitmap for every object type despite canonical type-specific GDI slots. ops_review assigned bounded source-backed corrections and realistic tests in the same isolated fixture, then repin/release. No source module, route, runtime, network or package change authorized. Existing conditional Collapse grant/queue retained and requires explicit Jazz release.


### Correction to Unreal repaint review

Root independently reread other-blit.asm and confirms owner clarification: BeginPaint RVA6388 is followed by GetDC6392, EAX->EDI6398 and BitBlt destination EDI. The prior review overstated a missing repaint DC association. Existing GetDC tracking is appropriate for that actual path. A realistic call-sequence test is requested; new BeginPaint tracking is optional. SelectObject untyped-object ambiguity remains a valid bounded correction.


## Jazz approval resolved — 2026-10-02T22:09:24.467451+00:00

Owner confirms extraction49039 terminal0, archive/fullfixture verified drift empty. Native execution approval resolved with exact host-scoped SSH prefix saved. Existing cell469 yielded SSH32166, freshly polled live/quiet by fp_parity; preflight/guest launch not yet confirmed. No duplicate invocation. Root task and status updated; no current Jazz approval response needed.


## Unreal source acceptance and Jazz launch — 2026-10-02T22:11:58.290826+00:00

Corrected observer6c09845d/tests a039344c/manifestd575968d/binding9fdff0f2 and driver/module/DLL all root-hashed against release. Root reviewed realistic repaint sequence, conservative untyped-selection invalidation/DIB restoration and actual driver partial-receipt/deadline tests; 18 tests pass. Local package preparation granted ops_review under new scratch/ops-unreal-attribution-package-20261002 and handoff, including static binding activation/repin, original wrapper guards and full archive readback. No remote authority yet; checkpoint packaging before conditional Collapse/Ricochet.

Jazz owner freshly polled same SSH32166 live. Preflight idle99.800/99.625/99.825 percent, MemAvailable7274548KiB, Node24.18.1/Chrome151; ownedPID/PGID578575 launched, startup00-08 captures present. Terminal/download/cleanup still pending; no host release inferred.

Only loading, logos and advancing intro cartoon observed over55.1s, noinput/no menu/no gameplay/noFPS. Review scratch/ops-jazz2-package-20261002/root-startup-review.md. fp_parity assigned local scene-gated intro-skip and source-backed viewport proposal only; no copy/runtime/transfer grant. Explicit Jazz release acknowledged, ops_review checkpoints Unreal package and activates existing Collapsev2 one-attempt grant.


## Jazz route implementation grant — 2026-10-02T22:19:08.182171+00:00

Root reviewed next-route-proposal.md. fp_parity granted new scratch/ops-jazz2-route-20261002 and corresponding handoff: shared lexical renderer access, read-only cached source/owner/crop/native metadata, distinct image and input transforms, pure observed-geometry and saved-reference gates, then isolated fixture integration if sound. Full ordinary scene-checked menu/character/difficulty/gameplay route with one gated cinematic Escape and actual control review. No new runtime/archive/transfer; NFS3 conditional priority retained. Root read paused Unreal package wrapper/test delta: five expected parameters only, static binding1fb4668a meaning no runtime authority, no concern; archive pending. Collapse owner polling same approved host-check cell457, no guest launch confirmed.

Earlier transfer/fullverification terminal0 accepted. Host prefix approval does not establish this command executed. Owner notified to preserve same pending request, no reissue/reroute. Guest launch unconfirmed. Local Jazz helper work remains available and goal active.


## Collapse live wrapper and Jazz calibration finding — 2026-10-02T22:26:11.092986+00:00

Collapse approval3f8b7824 resolved; existing cell467 yielded exec15988, freshly polled live by owner. No preflight/gameplay outcome inferred; no duplicate. Jazz local preparation-result/calibration reviewed: geometry tests pass, all5 held-out intro frames fail provisional recognizer, including a publisher negative nearer than another intro. No fixture integrated or gate accepted. fp_parity assigned bounded fresh-live-image root-review proposal for one ordinary Escape, preserving exact scene/window/deadline and normal route checks; no new runtime authority. CSS transform rejection also requested for geometry mapping.


## Collapse sampled control accepted — 2026-10-02T22:30:38.971472+00:00

Actual mapping content800x600 at4,26 inside808x628, no USER802x601 stretch. Terminal0/cleanuptrue/no residue/postinputs unchanged, explicit release accepted. Ricochet existing grant activated by ops_review. serious_review assigned NEW read-only Collapse counter review/handoff across six origins/API/surface/clock/shutdown boundaries; conditional GTA2 priority retained. Jazz bounded frozen visual-review gate local implementation granted, actual input transport must support Escape delivery upon resume; no new runtime authority.


## Collapse counter audit accepted; Ricochet host gate — 2026-10-02T22:34:33.951608+00:00

Root independently verified exact six context arm/stop/clock/start sets, zero drops/errors/no in-window workers, sole59 uploads atworker6/thread5; all10 source hashes match evidencec84ae2c3. Audit accepted: child800x600 upload does not equal cached802x601 top-level client or proven frame. serious_review assigned NEW local API/callsite/canonical child-parent attribution prototype/proof, no large fixture copy/runtime/build/network. GTA2 conditional priority preserved. Jazz owner reports actual frozen scheduler/input tests and CSS guards pass; key held across resume avoids cleared physical key state, actual menu transition stillneeded.

Root read Jazz review helper and tests: receipt identity/one-shot/frozen input sequencing align; actual boundedReview timer winning a delayed await test requested to validate late-continuation guard. Final integration/source/capture identities still awaited.


## Jazz source accepted; Collapse prototype review — 2026-10-02T22:43:01.228110+00:00

Jazz final source/receipt/CSS/test release reviewed and22 release hashes independently matched. Driver18ef41ad, route01c2d987, review43203301, manifest9099f6bd, portablea400a150; unchangedda5 module. fp_parity assigned NEW local route-package root/handoff, exact wrapper delta inclqualify-reviewed and12357inputs247links, inherited650/resource/attempt/cleanup guards, full readback after packing. No review receipt generated, no runtime/network; packing deferred during Ricochet and NFS3 priority retained.

Root read Collapse observer7d55a07d/handoff; acceptance deferred for explicit stop bypassing10s cap and successful selected transfers with no upload omitted from one-to-one assessment.

Ten focused pure tests pass; all12 source/prototype identities independently matched (observera89d0c46/test292524c3). serious_review assigned NEW scratch/ops-collapse-association-20261002 + handoff for read-only typed DC/bitmap/window records derived from exact RegionMap/layout, child-to-top-level canonical association/origin, serialized observer and six-context immutable coverage tests. No large fixture copy/module build/browser/network/runtime yet. Render role at shared BitBlt site remains unknown and gameFrameQualifiedfalse; conditional GTA2 afterNFS3 retained.


## Ricochet execution terminal; evidence pending — 2026-10-02T22:54:10.562672+00:00

Owner reports extraction26290 terminal0 with all12663 archive members,12647 inputs/247 links and pinned module/manifest verified, drift[]. Native execution approval cleared; same execution78385 now terminal0. Wrapper status alone is not driver success. Owner collecting/downloading all artifacts and verifying cleanup before explicit ASCII release to fp_parity for conditional NFS3; GTA2 remains next after NFS3. No additional user response currently required and no retry or competing remote probe authorized. Root acceptance awaits raw evidence and eight visual checkpoints.


## Ricochet root evidence review; NFS3 activated — 2026-10-02T22:57:37.746120+00:00

Root audit100 hashes/raw arithmetic passes, all8 client images personally viewed. Animated ready board with identical full bricks/zero score/apparently attached ball: active gameplay measurement unaccepted, no FPS publication. Detailed scratch/ops-ricochet-root-audit-20261002/root-review.md. Owner assigned ordinary launch/source/scene followup after Unreal package, no runtime retry. Explicit Ricochet clean release accepted; fp_parity NFS3 transfer19171 live, GTA2 conditional next. serious_review association preparation released, root review pending; assigned independent callsite proof in scratch/ops-collapse-callsite-review-20261002, no runtime.

Root prepared scratch/ops-jazz2-root-review-20261002/check.js, read-only/no receipt generation. Accepted source/manifest/decoder pins, request/report binding, decoded native pixels and full screenshot crop/geometry verified before personal review. Syntax and meaningful historical startup-bundle rejection pass; live positive path remains untested. fp_parity notified. Existing NFS3 collection native request retained; no remote operation or queue change from this preparation.


## Independent Collapse loader-source review — 2026-10-02T23:08:30.788907+00:00

Root inspected pinned v2 host.js loadExe2817–2863 and registerModule3430. Retained _exeBytes are the actual load input; worker get_image_base metadata initializes the main shadow instance. moduleMap has nearest-base entries without size and is unsuitable as required EXE evidence. Root confirmed serious_review may use exact retained-byte hash, validated PE SizeOfImage, loader-published base and every worker actual relocated instruction witness, with nonwrapping range/read bounds and fail-closed missing bindings. No private register mutation or preferred-base assumption. Integration remains worker-owned and unfinished; no runtime acceptance granted.


## NFS3 failure root-reviewed; GTA2 activation — 2026-10-02T23:11:47.159199+00:00

Root34 artifact hashes independently match; terminal1/no outer timeout/cleanup true/residue empty/post drift empty. Last.png personally viewed: blue car/wooded wet road/debug overlay, no post-countdown/control/timing acceptance. CDP SwiftShader vs endpoint Intel/Mesa identity mismatch at classify15/runCase315, no renderer errors. fp_parity assigned NEW bounded local backend review; no retry/gate relaxation. Explicit release accepted and serious_review checkpointing Collapse to activate existing GTA2 grant; Unreal remains conditional next. Root asked Ricochet owner to source-prove actual renderer/viewport lookup and stable crop before final pinning.


## GTA2 request canceled; no remote launch — 2026-10-02T23:19:37.176784+00:00

Dashboard showed only preflight approvalb5f71fd0 first23:12:33Z. Root interrupted owned worker to enforce freeze. serious_review confirms aborted after367.4s, no SSH session handle; no directory, transfer, wrapper or guest/browser requested or started. Conditional GTA2/Unreal launches canceled. Local Collapse checkpoint62303 terminal0; final audit/closure unfinished. Durable release being written.

fp_parity24369 remains live/quiet: python3 scratch/ops-jazz2-route-package-20261002/package-qualification.py redirected to package-build.log, original cwd. Root scoped pgrep found candidate PID76365; detailed ps blocked by sandbox, attribution not confirmed. Original owner handle authoritative. Preserve mutable partial package; do not restart on destination.


## Freeze collection complete — 2026-10-02T23:23:51.028480+00:00

Final Jazz owner poll43da91 reports original session24369 terminal0. Root read package-receipt.json: archive9565f8e15fdd6bc6c1934f2dae304b33994f94c4cb9f819a49d71e876e537069,126537811bytes;12372 regular members/247 links, full byte/link readback true; original and fixture drift empty;12357 inputs plus manifest, unchanged da5bf93b module. Inventoryaad29937, wrapperb90054bb. No upload/runtime/automatic receipt. These are owner verification receipts; root did not repeat the entire archive validation during freeze, and final package review/runtime authorization remains future work.

All three worker task/resource releases are now received. No active worker job or conditional launch remains. Root begins idle freeze after this final documentation. Historical root watcher69315 and all foreign services/jobs remain preserved; this does not claim they stopped. Migration owner ops-dashboard can reconcile the now-stable worker artifacts/private evidence. Root has not committed/pushed/copied project or memory and does not assert migration completed. New coordinator must explicitly acquire ownership before resuming unfinished tasks.


## Migrated coordinator resumed — 2026-10-03T08:34:16.414Z

Owner codex:01a0ff91-cf9d-7f42-ba93-f9e7616b35a5; new persistent box bx_69aem736; core release read and verified owner receipt accepted. All old local worker and five Claude claims released; historical foreign remote resources remain unverified. STATUS/TODOS authorship acquired. Own board watcher exec session80820, isolated headful browser session3665 (Blobby qualification), and category/coverage/evidence workers. Canonical build passed all gates; module SHA256 6cdc021dbf55ccc68cbcdb22d622adef7a13bb42a4cb56e9c4a8f233f1868886. Existing uncommitted source preserved; no REP validation or deployment. Current tasks OPS-ALL-GAMEPLAY-COVERAGE and OPS-EXE-CATEGORIES; missing files recorded per game.

### Coverage checkpoint 2026-10-03T08:53:21.378Z

Live dashboard reloaded via existing wine-ops.service; gateway and Telegram untouched. 241 entries/14 categories; root inspected live grouped screenshot,27focused tests and worker synthetic/live browser checks pass. 152 per-game/distribution tasks persisted (one noninteractive BG demo deferred;15 game asset sets presently available). Exact task inputs: scratch/gameplay-coverage-20261003/tasks/. Fresh root-reviewed gameplay screenshots: Blobby, DX-Ball, SkiFree, Minesweeper, Solitaire, Taipei. Generic callback FPS rejected (GDI proxy and duplicated DirectDraw events). Blobby marker0x44528b calibration65 completed callbacks/65 covered groups remains diagnostic pending hardened gate review; coverage_audit owns helper/review. restore_evidence currently owns serial nine-game screenshot slot after counter worker release. corpus_categories independently reviews counter gates. No foreign host work or archived fixtures resumed.

### Coverage and logical-frame review 2026-10-03T09:11:38.384Z

Thirteen fresh gameplay scenes now captured; twelve have reviewed ordinary input response, Rattler only living motion (steering unverified). FreeCell16/Hearts16 setup traps preserved. Root personally reviewed Blobby attempt4 jump/move and all18 sample screenshots: active ball and AI movement, score4→5 /11→12 /12→14; no menus, gameover, or sustained serve idle. Independent corpus_categories review accepts pinned completed render submission marker and all exact dirty-list transfers:157/155/155 frames over5120.10/5104.28/5087.685ms. Weighted30.4988 logical gameplay frames/s, instrumented; physical display FPS unknown. Coverage owner publishing exact raw/hash/review receipts. Root added explicit metric normalization and logical label;23ops tests pass. Root DXBall/Blobby runtimes are closed. All15 original game batch and corrected Snake runtime closed. Counter runtime39780 exit0, no residue. corpus_categories now owns bounded Win16 caught-exception diagnosis only; existing REP blocker untouched.

### Win16 narrow guard checkpoint 2026-10-03T09:21:04.974Z

Root reviewed three-line nonzero modeless-pending guard and meaningful regression: zero/no-match preserves invocation frame, true match returns HWND/EIP/ESP. Focused test PASS; in-memory old predicate fails on erroneous six-byte consumption. Full canonical build PASS, new module3d374324cd29153dd9354b855c98f0c52b44b709facbb8d1b67941fd9f05dddf. Ordinary FreeCell still fails; no full-fix claim and no Hearts run. corpus_categories owns one page+Worker caught-exception diagnostic; coverage_audit owns read-only DX-Ball counter plan, no runtime. Blobby's accepted measurement remains pinned to earlier6cdc021d module; do not silently rerun its hard-pinned observer on the new module.

### Available-game screenshot completion 2026-10-03T09:42:14.726Z

All15 initially available game asset sets have fresh reviewed gameplay scenes (14 ordinary input responses; Rattler steering unverified). Root personally viewed FreeCell moved-card and Hearts passed images. Worker routing and groupbox transparency fixes accepted; three renderer tests pass, Win16 guard negative regression detects old six-byte frame consumption, canonical build passes. Clipping separately queued WIN16-DIALOG-GEOMETRY. WIN16-DIALOG-WORKER-TRAP done. Final Hearts bundle scratch/runs/20261003-mshearts16-gameplay-worker-route.

Owner priority restoration receipt3275/3275 hashes with no missing/different accepted;81 game entries associated, not automatic runtime acceptance.136 former fixture-blocked tasks now backlog with shared MIG-FIXTURE-RESTORE dependency, exact path files retained. restore_evidence owns corrected actual-EXE/dependency inventory and readiness deltas; root retains task lock authorship. coverage_audit owns bounded DX-Ball runtime and independent reviewer corpus_categories; all prior runtime resources released. New root board watcher92471 replaces stopped80820.

### Restored batch and short-window counter checkpoint — 2026-10-03T10:04:08.557Z

Six restored titles are published, all runtime resources closed. Reversi move/reply and EmPipe placement accepted; Bricks and Pinball show game scenes with unverified controls. Total19 fresh scenes/16 input-responsive titles across21 attempted. Rodent implicit VB6 dependency is exactly test/binaries/dlls/msvbvm60.dll; migration owner requested, task shares restoration dependency. Tetravex New Game traps on _TrackMouseEvent; separate WIN32-TRACKMOUSEEVENT task persisted. Complete declared routes remain93/152, not runtime passes.

DX attempt1/2 remain rejected. Contract3 attempt3 raw27c857df independently counter-reviewed:34 completed iterations in564.55ms; root viewed all7 images with launch/paddle movement, active ball and brick/score progression. Two fresh routes pending under unchanged strict contract, no published DX rate yet. coverage_audit holds serial runtime slot; restore_evidence preparing next six read-only. Root watcher92471 live; no remote work, commits or broad cleanup.

### DX qualification and second restored batch — 2026-10-03T10:12:49.269Z

DX completed: root personally reviewed all21 images and independent reviewer accepted exact raw chains. Published qualification3e0626ec1b9742091418714e4ca3d06e55943947c72dfcc7ac3018123a062058;101 frames/1677.21ms,60.219 logical gameplay frames/s. Three short instrumented windows, no sustained/physical display FPS or p95 claim.18 focused tests pass;73 artifacts+21 screenshots present, live dashboard normalized correctly. Old attempts1/2 remain rejected; helper/runtime ownership released.

Batch2 published5 limited input-responsive gameplay scenes (Funtris, FourStones, Pyramid, Peaks, CWordZap); QBlackjack exits before deal, reports implicit test/binaries/dlls/oleaut32.dll missing with causality unproven. Shared restoration dependency and exact evidence persisted.24 fresh scenes,21 input-responsive across27 attempted titles. All batch2 resources closed. Batch3 Cave Story/Elasto Mania/Icy Tower/GeneRally/NetHack/SimCity demo assigned restore_evidence; canonical build/browser JS stable during captures. corpus_categories may prepare WAT-only TrackMouseEvent repair/tests without build/browser mutation; coverage_audit read-only Funtris counter analysis. Root retains task/status ownership and watcher92471.

### Third restored batch and API repair boundary — 2026-10-03T10:22:49.092Z

Batch3 published six rows. Cave Story and Icy Tower movement/jump verified, Elasto motorcycle field scene-only. GeneRally countdown excluded from gameplay; private server percent-decoding bug fixed with malformed/NUL/containment guards and one documented rerun, original setup failure preserved. NetHack initialization fails after missing test/binaries/dlls/comctl32.dll; SimCity remains desktop, same missing DLL but causal link unproven. Exact dynamic dependencies persisted and migration owner requested.27 fresh gameplay scenes/23 input-responsive titles across33 published title attempts; two accepted logical frame rates.

All seven batch3 helper attempts closed, final GeneRally30957 exit0, ps clear. Browser/source/build slot reserved to corpus_categories for TrackMouseEvent integration/review; appended272-byte shared region preserves all prior bases and ends0x07d16760. Root review identified QUERY timeout and cross-thread behavior assumptions; worker correcting from Wine implementation and documenting internal failure policies. coverage_audit independently reviewing final patch when ready. No Tetravex runtime grant yet.

Funtris source proves gravity-message updates and tile blits are not one complete frame; exact limitation saved. Icy Tower packed EXE has no on-disk render body and no available unpacker/verified unpacked copy; post-unpack identity/caller proof plan saved. Both FPS remain unknown. restore_evidence prepared Pocket Tanks/Moorhuhn/Liquid War/QBob/Tile World/WEP16 Chips offline; no runtime grant during repair.

### TrackMouseEvent closure and reviewed-image dashboard — 2026-10-03T10:44:26.515Z

Narrow client-LEAVE repair independently reviewed, focused WAT/renderer tests and existing input regressions pass; canonical build all gates PASS. New module d2c455f7b5f834f3fdb52e42e6d37d34343d5864f5273d1b3dac9d2a1a334bff,1656607bytes. Explicit HOVER/NONCLIENT/unknown flags remain unsupported; defensive error choices documented, no full native API parity claim. Root viewed Tetravex new-game and tile-moved images: numbered board accepted, drag response degraded with repeated trails. WIN32-TRACKMOUSEEVENT done; GAMEPLAY-tetravex now depends on new TETRAVEX-DRAG-TRAILS. Runtime39748 exit0/resources clean.28 scenes/23 verified input-responsive titles across33 attempted.

Root ops reader/UI now normalizes only explicit reviewed image allowlists with named reviewers, rejects diagrams/unsafe/missing images and route-text promotion. Corpus prefers newest reviewed gameplay image, labels earlier images while retaining latest outcome.24ops tests PASS; wine-ops.service reloaded via sudo-n after plain systemctl required authentication (no prompt/approval used). Root live browser67886 exit0: DX thumbnail attempt5/sample-5, gameplay badge and60.2logical label verified; screenshot scratch/ops-preview/reviewed-gameplay-live.png personally viewed. Gateway untouched.

Task reconciliation was checked at full task-block boundaries;21 current Next/Evidence sections refreshed and stale Tetravex API dependency removed. Icy Tower one90sec read-only post-unpack diagnostic assigned coverage_audit next, exact current module pins; no FPS claim. Batch4 six-title helper/dependencies ready offline; no parallel runtime. Root watcher92471 retained.

### 2026-10-03T11:16:10.852Z — batch4 and diagnostics
Batch4 reconciled:32 reviewed fresh gameplay titles across39 attempted,25 limited input responses; no broad FPS claim. Icy attempt3 ended at title with loaded hashes retained, no heap/counter capture. Tetravex attempt3 real numbered-board drag reproduced parent-DIB trails; Worker trace shows13 custom child moves and no parent paint/damage. Batch5 worker owns sole serialized browser slot on d2c455 canonical. Root memory RIFF repair/private regression passes initial sparse/nested/padding/malformed cases; independent review found parent lower-bound and odd-offset padding corrections, now testing. No canonical build while batch5 active.

### 2026-10-03T11:25:29.400Z — batch5 published
Six routes pinned d2c455 closed cleanly. Atomic Bomberman/Claw/Monkey Island/Fallout scenes and limited movement accepted; TA scene-only, Dungeon Keeper menu route incomplete. Fresh totals37 scenes/29 input-responsive titles across45 attempted. All FPSnull for this batch. Generic404 logs lacked exact URLs; limitation recorded rather than inventing paths, next helper corrects logging. Root viewed Claw/Fallout/TA gameplay captures. Per-game JSON/TODOS reconciled, no completion claim. Icy4 owns next serial diagnostic with delegated human title/tower review; WAT-only controls repair ongoing, no canonical build yet.

### 2026-10-03T11:32:55.577Z — batch6 published
Six WEP routes closed normally on d2c455. JezzBall/Pipe/GoFigure limited responses, Maxwell scene-only, Klotski/Tetris startup dialogs incomplete. Fresh totals41 scenes/32 responses across51 attempted entries. Exact404 URL/path and contextual review artifacts retained per game; no newly established required missing game dependency. Per-game JSON/TODOS reconciled; all FPS remain unqualified for this batch. Browser slot released for repairs.

### 2026-10-03T11:41:26.228Z — combined repair build and QBob scene
Independent audio/controls reviews accepted; all canonical gates pass on939943d4 (1,657,461 bytes). QBob ordinary license/F1 reaches active pyramid/player score10, no original memory RIFF trap. Scene-only, no movement input before120s deadline; published immutable run. MMIO task done, QBob gameplay task ready, missing comctl32 retained as unproven gap. Fresh totals42 scenes/32 limited responses across51 attempted entries. Corrected Tetravex qualification currently owns sole browser slot; batch7 prepared offline.

### 2026-10-03T11:48:00.282Z — batch7 published
Six more WEP routes closed normally on939943d4: all six reviewed scenes, Golf/Pegged/TicTactics/Taipei/Minesweeper limited responses. Cruel scene-only after F2 startup route; initial partial paint retained, no verified redeal response. Fresh totals48 scenes/38 responses across57 attempted entries, including QBob scene and corrected Tetravex response. Exact failed requests and artifact hashes retained. All new FPS remain unknown. Batch7 browser released; next games prepared offline while debugger retarget regression proceeds.

### 2026-10-03T12:00:38.407Z — batch8 published
Six WEP routes closed normally on2c22cb7d, all six reviewed scenes. Stones/TriPeaks/WordZap limited responses; Rattler/Tut/Rodent scene-only. Rodent first Right crossed startup, so visible displacement retained but not a separate in-game response. Fresh totals54 scenes/41 responses across63 attempted entries. Per-game task/evidence reconciled; no new FPS. Klotski diagnostic owns serial slot; initial newborn-Worker timer setup failure preserved, corrected bounded retry authorized. Icy5 prepared for next diagnostic slot.

### 2026-10-03T12:18:09.178Z — batch9 published
Six routes closed on canonical2c22; five scenes and three limited input responses reviewed. Chess e2-e4/reply, Blackjack deal and FreeCell card transfer succeeded. Ski steering remains unqualified; TicTacDrop board preceded a VB error, and JigSawed About close trapped. Root spot-reviewed Chess and TicTacDrop evidence. Fresh totals59 scenes/44 verified responses across69 attempted entries. No new FPS. Modal repair under source review; browser/build slot currently reserved for its qualification.

### 2026-10-03T12:20:25.334Z — evidence-count audit
Passed outcome alone is not input proof: Snake early-route accepted an alive moving scene but Left preceded visible snake, so the correct total remains44 input responses (45 passed+scene candidates minus Snake). Detailed receipt scratch/batch9-blocker-count-audit-20261003.json. JigSawed trap follows About creation; available logs cannot establish close-click causality. Both new failure routes have all declared/import DLLs; no missing guest path proved.

### 2026-10-03T12:22:17.776Z — modal build and runtime handoff

### 2026-10-03T12:25:49.435Z — modal repair qualified, broader route incomplete
Ordinary visible Welcome OK now dismisses Klotski through owning Worker on5ff4844e (root viewed after-observation). WIN16-MODAL-QUEUE done by its narrow acceptance, tests/build/actualroute.

Fresh totals: 69 scenes, 50 limited input responses, 74 attempted entries; three qualified logical measurements. Root spot-reviewed Tetris before/after, Quick Blackjack bust and SimCity map. Tetris horizontal response stands, but gravity also advanced the piece vertically; original same-row wording corrected in task receipt without rewriting immutable result. Thirteen shared DLLs installed and rehashed at runtime-free boundary; Rodent ASYCFILT restored, previous failed run retained. Cave Story 51478 closed at 13:17:41.923Z after dialogue-only route; no debugger capture, no guest failure inferred. restore_evidence now owns sole ordinary browser for Rodent retry and compact batch12. corpus_categories owns renderer-input Escape repair and focused tests only; coverage_audit prepares Cave route offline. No canonical build or FPS benchmark concurrently authorized.

### 2026-10-03T13:30:21.581Z — next routes and repair review
Root independently ran menu Escape focused test and Cave route/clipper 19 tests, all PASS. Menu source8b43a6a4 released; no WAT change or compilation required. Batch12 browser remains restore_evidence owned; Tetris qualification queued next, Cave diagnostic after that. Offline batch13 routes for StarCraft, Worms2, ScummVM FOTAQ, Moorhuhn Winter, Runenlegen and JigssawMe prepared with exact source hashes and zero declared gaps in scratch/gameplay-restored-batch13-20261003/preparation.json; no runtime grant yet. Aggregate audit independently confirms 69 fresh scenes, 99 declared-ready game entries and three logical measurements. Historical non-image gaps remain81 exact paths, separate from gameplay evidence. Active task owners all match current coordinator; old owner IDs only retained in historical completed/deferred records. Live8098 api/state confirms241 candidates/14 categories and current STATUS.

### 2026-10-03T13:39:18.061Z — batch12 results
Six immutable runs published: four new scenes and four limited responses (Rodent, LF2, Pawn, Spider); Jardinains and Marbles remain menu-only. Root spot-reviewed all four scenes. Totals73 fresh scenes/54 limited responses/79 attempted. LF2 clipped scene explicitly limited; viewport1024x768 but renderer canvas1024x740, actual primary dimensions not yet captured. DDRAW-WINDOWED-PRIMARY-SIZE separates current-desktop allocation from retained last-mode state to preserve RCT behavior. Allsix runtimes released, finalSpider13:35:28. Tetris owns sole browser; Cave follows. Batch13 remains prepared, no runtime grant.

### 2026-10-03T13:41:44.517Z — menu repair accepted
Root personally viewed open-menu Escape leaves active Tetris board and closed popup, while subsequent menu-closed Escape intentionally minimizes. WIN16-MENU-VISIBILITY done, scoped immutable result preserves overall unknown due to subsequent taskbar click. TASKBAR-RESTORE-INPUT records exact missing DOM hit/click/minimized fields; recreating task buttons on repaint is only a source hypothesis.
