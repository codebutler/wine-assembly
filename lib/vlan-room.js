// One game, one room, no dialog — docs/virtual-lan-party.md
//
// Opening a game's LAN is automatic: the first person on a game's channel
// OWNS the room (seat 10.0.0.1) and everyone after them JOINS it, over one
// link each (lib/vlan-star.js). Nobody picks anybody. The game's own server
// browser does the finding, exactly as it did on a 1998 LAN, because every
// machine in the room is on the same segment.
//
//   openRoom()
//     join the channel with no seat
//     somebody owns a room here?  -> offer to them; their answer carries our seat
//     nobody?                     -> take seat 1, own the room, answer everyone
//
// Two people opening an empty channel at the same moment both become owners.
// The one with the higher user id steps down while it still has nobody in its
// room -- the same no-clock rule the lobby uses for glare.
//
// The owner leaving ends the room: members hear 'closed' and the next person
// to go online starts a new one. There is no hand-over, on purpose -- a game
// server is usually the owner, and when it goes the game is over anyway.
