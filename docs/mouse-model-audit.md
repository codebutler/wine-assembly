```

- **There is no runtime detection today.** Capture is a hand-set per-app flag
  (`relativeMouse: true` in `lib/apps.js`; `mobileTouch` overrides the phone
  mode). A game that needs capture and lacks the flag gets absolute input.
- **Static evidence finds the candidates but cannot decide them.**
  `tools/mouse-model-census.js` reads every module of all 270 registry apps:
  54 carry `GUID_SysMouse`, 18 import `SetCursorPos`+`ClipCursor`, 28 only
  `SetCursorPos`, 65 are configured against the static suggestion. But a
  `GUID_SysMouse` is in the data of anything linked with `dxguid.lib` (aoe2,
  rct, heroes3 carry it), and Blood II opens its mouse through `EnumDevices`
  without that GUID at all.
- **The decision belongs at runtime, from two signals the emulator already
  sees** (section "Autodetect"): a DirectInput mouse acquired
  `DISCL_EXCLUSIVE`, or a `SetCursorPos` recentring loop. Either one means
  "capture"; neither means absolute.
- **Blood II now captures by default** (`relativeMouse: true`,
  `mobileTouch: 'trackpad'`), with its DirectInput mouse-look verified.

## What the page does with each flag

| flag (lib/apps.js) | desktop | phone |
|---|---|---|
| none (default) | absolute: the guest Win32 cursor follows the pointer | absolute taps; `auto` touch mode follows `relativeMouse` |
| `relativeMouse: true` | first click requests Pointer Lock; `movementX/Y` move the guest cursor by deltas (`renderer.handleRelativeMouseMove`); moves are held back until the lock is granted | virtual trackpad (drag = relative motion, tap = click at the guest cursor) |
| `mobileTouch: 'trackpad' / 'direct'` | — | forces the phone mode either way |
| `hideHostCursor: true` | hide the browser pointer during exclusive presentation | — |

Runtime already handled: the host pointer is hidden whenever the guest hides
its own cursor (`ShowCursor` count < 0 or `SetCursor(NULL)`;
`renderer.wantsHiddenMouse`). Cursor visibility does not decide the protocol
(Diablo hides its cursor and reads absolute positions), which is why the
capture choice was made explicit.

## Why absolute input breaks captured games

- **Recentring games** (Quake II engine: Quake II, Anachronox, Half-Life,
  Unreal) call `SetCursorPos(centre)` every frame and read
  `GetCursorPos - centre` as the motion. An absolute page pointer that rests
  off-centre reads as the same displacement every frame: the cursor runs into a
  corner and stays there (Anachronox's menu, 2026-10-06), or the view spins.
- **DirectInput mouse games** (Blood II, Descent 3, Drakan, AvP) read relative
  counts. Our DirectInput mouse turns page pointer movement into counts, which
  works until the pointer reaches the edge of the page: then turning stops.
  Pointer Lock has no edge.

## Autodetect (implemented 2026-10-06, MOUSE-AUTODETECT)

An app whose registry entry has no `relativeMouse` now follows the guest:
`lib/browser-input.js` asks `renderer.wantsRelativeMouse(x, y, 'auto')`,
which (during exclusive presentation only, as before) returns true when

- `renderer._noteCursorWarp` saw a recentring loop: three `SetCursorPos`
  warps to one point (within 2 px), each within 500 ms of the last. It stays
  armed for 2 s after the latest such warp, so a menu that stops recentring
  gets the plain cursor back. Every guest thread's `SetCursorPos` reaches
  this renderer through `set_mouse_position`.
- or the WAT export `get_mouse_capture_hint` reports a DirectInput mouse
  (device kind 2) that is acquired with `DISCL_EXCLUSIVE`. It scans the DX
  object table in shared memory, so a device acquired on any guest thread
  counts; the page polls it at most every 250 ms.

`relativeMouse: true` / `false` remain explicit overrides
(`lib/browser-shell.js` now passes an absent flag through as undefined
instead of false). Pointer Lock still needs the player's click; the signal
only decides that the click asks for it, and on a phone `mobileTouch: 'auto'`
follows the same answer. Covered by `test/test-relative-mouse-autodetect.js`.
Not covered: in Threads mode the page instance may not expose
`get_mouse_capture_hint`, so there only the recentring signal applies.

## Autodetect (the original proposal)

Both deciding signals pass through code we own:

1. **Exclusive DirectInput mouse.** `IDirectInputDevice::SetCooperativeLevel`
   (src/09a8-handlers-directx.wat) stores each device's flags. A mouse device
   (`GUID_SysMouse`, or an enumerated `DI8DEVTYPE_MOUSE`/`DIDEVTYPE_MOUSE`)
   that is `Acquire`d with `DISCL_EXCLUSIVE` hides the Windows cursor and
   delivers counts only: capture. A NONEXCLUSIVE mouse is used for buttons or
   polling beside the system cursor: keep absolute.
2. **Recentring loop.** `SetCursorPos` reaches the host through
   `$host_set_mouse_position`. Three or more calls within ~1 s that land within
   a few pixels of the same point inside the game window (its centre in every
   case seen) is the recentring idiom: capture. A one-off warp (Diablo,
   Solitaire's card drag, screensavers) never repeats.

The WAT side raises a per-process `wants_relative_mouse` latch from either
signal and clears it when the device is Unacquired or the loop stops for a few
seconds (menus in Unreal and Blood II use the absolute cursor). The page reads
it where it reads `app.relativeMouse` today (`lib/browser-input.js`
`wantsRelativeMouse`): `relativeMouse: true/false` in the registry stays as an
explicit override; absent means "follow the latch". Pointer Lock still needs a
click, so the latch only arms capture for the next click — the same flow a
flagged app has today.

## The table

`node tools/mouse-model-census.js` (add `--all` for the 154 plain-absolute
apps, `--json` for the evidence). `*` = the configured default disagrees with
the static suggestion. "relative?" and "runtime" rows are the ones the
autodetect signals settle; the static column alone is not a verdict.

## Follow-ups

| row | what |
|---|---|
| MOUSE-AUTODETECT | implement the latch above (WAT signals + `wantsRelativeMouse`), with a unit test per signal |
| MOUSE-DYNAMIC-CENSUS | boat sweep: run each `*` app to its first interactive screen with `--trace-api=SetCursorPos,IDirectInputDevice_SetCooperativeLevel,IDirectInputDevice_Acquire` and record which signal fires; replaces the static column |
| MOUSE-FLAG-FPS | mouse-look 3D games with DirectInput mouse that should capture now, each verified like Blood II: descent3_demo, drakan_demo, daikatana_demo, avp_alien_demo, avp_marine_demo, die_by_the_sword_demo, freespace_demo, mw3, hype_glide_demo |
