# D3D root QueryInterface identity

2026-09-22. Scope: the root-family branch of the shared D3DIM QI core,
called by IDirect3D1/2/3/7.

## Finding and change

The core recognized only the first GUID word. Changing another word still
returned success and gained a reference; the new regression reproduced this.
Its IUnknown path also chose the current wrapper's vtable, allowing an
upgraded root interface to return a different IUnknown pointer.

Root queries now reuse the existing complete DirectDraw/D3D GUID classifier,
without duplicating its constants. A single 16-byte guest span handles a
GUID crossing nonadjacent sparse pages and is released before ownership
changes or returns. Rejected queries clear the output and do not AddRef;
null output or null IID returns E_POINTER. The supported set is unchanged:
IUnknown, the existing DirectDraw1 parent path, and D3D1/2/3/7.

IUnknown now returns the root entry's primary wrapper and gains one reference.
That enforces identity across the root's versioned wrappers, as required by
[Microsoft's QueryInterface rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/rules-for-implementing-queryinterface).
It does not establish a common identity between the separately allocated
DirectDraw and D3D entries.

## Coverage

test/test-d3d-root-query-interface.js calls all four public API-table QI
entries. It tests 96 GUID corruptions (each of four words independently),
all 16 root-version upgrade combinations, preserved original vtables,
canonical IUnknown, null inputs, output clearing, stack guards and balanced
reference counts. Another 64 cycles use deliberately nonadjacent sparse
pages for a crossing GUID and crossing output, checking that temporary
guest-span storage returns to its original cursor.

Root/device lifetime and DirectDraw QI regressions also pass. Scoped fragment,
ESP, logical-operand, epilogue, quiet-inventory, duplicate, test-tier and
whitespace gates pass. Quiet counts remain 243 manual + 22 metadata;
duplicate counts remain 123 groups / 487 members.

## Remaining

DirectDraw-parent retention, the slot-zero ambiguity/fallback scan, and
native Win98 interface-generation rules remain open. Other D3DIM interface
families still use the older partial-IID core; this change deliberately
does not claim those families were audited. Invalid non-null pointers and
guest-span arena exhaustion are not certified by this regression.

No native Win98, browser/gameplay, full-build or performance claim is made.

## Shared dispatch follow-up

The four root QueryInterface handlers were compared before editing: their
bodies were byte-identical after normalizing only the function name and
whitespace. IDirect3D2/3/7 now alias IDirect3D_QueryInterface in the API table;
the D3DIM interface spec retains the aliases for versions 2/7. Three redundant
runtime handlers are removed, and generated dispatch is refreshed.

The existing runtime regression now also asserts these aliases and the absence
of duplicate wrappers. Its structural check failed before the change; all
runtime cases and the 211-method interface-spec regression pass afterward.
Scoped gates pass. Exact duplicates drop from 123 groups / 487 members to
122 groups / 483 members; quiet counts remain 243 manual + 22 metadata.
This changes dispatch ownership, not the supported interface set or ABI.
