# Silent-handler inventory history

The build gate in `tools/check-silent-stubs.js` rejects additions or mutations
to straight-line handlers that cannot delegate work, publish output, branch, or
fail loudly. Its executable source intentionally contains only the classifier,
the current count/hash pin, and enforcement. This file preserves the historical
count changes and their behavior rationale without making every explanation a
change to gate code.

When an existing quiet handler gains real behavior, update the two-value pin in
the same commit. Append a dated explanation here when it adds useful context.

This is a ratchet, not approval of the old entries. Any addition or mutation
changes the digest and stops the build; deleting/fixing an entry deliberately
lowers the count and updates the digest after review.

2026-08-31: 506 -> 505. Commit 34b4f08f ("Fix Win98 installer chain
launches") gave handle_CreateProcessA a real implementation, so it left the
quiet inventory. Ratchet only; nothing was added.

2026-08-31: 505 -> 508. MSVCRT startup helpers _lock, _unlock, and
__lconv_init are documented compatibility no-ops for single-threaded CRT
initialization paths.

2026-09-01: 508 -> 507. handle_IDirectDraw_WaitForVerticalBlank was the
textbook silent success -- it set EAX=0 and returned, so a game that used
the display as its clock was told the retrace had already happened. It now
parks on a real vblank (yield_reason 13). Ratchet only; nothing was added.

2026-09-01: 507 -> 525. Minimal no-audio BASS compatibility handlers let
shareware games bundled with bass.dll continue to gameplay.

2026-09-01: 525 -> 526. __mb_cur_max is a documented constant for the
emulator's single-byte ANSI CRT environment.

2026-09-01: 526 -> 527. _cexit acknowledges CRT cleanup without process
termination; returning terminator callbacks need a separate future path.

2026-09-01: 527 -> 528. _getdrive is a documented constant in the default
single-drive C: process environment.

2026-09-01: 528 -> 529. _setmode acknowledges text/binary mode changes and
returns the previous text mode because stdio streams are not distinguished.

2026-09-01: 529 -> 530. keybd_event is a legacy input-synthesis probe shim;
browser-side input injection remains host-owned.

2026-09-01: 530 -> 531. joyGetPosEx mirrors joyGetPos for a no-joystick
Win98 environment so startup probes can keep keyboard/mouse input.

2026-09-02: 531 -> 529. Legacy SetWindowsHookA/W now installs the same
process-local keyboard/CBT callbacks as the Ex path, and UnhookWindowsHook
removes only a matching installed procedure instead of always succeeding.

2026-09-02: 529 -> 516. DirectPlay's bounded local session now retains
player/group identities, names, flags and memberships; its lifecycle and
four entity enumerators update or traverse that state instead of returning
success without work.

2026-09-02: 516 -> 514. SetPlayerData and SetGroupData now retain copied
local/remote application data in the DirectPlay entity repository; their
matching getters implement the Win98 size-query and readback contract.

2026-09-02: 514 -> 512. DirectPlayLobby EnumAddress now walks bounded
compound-address chunks through a cancellation-aware callback, while
EnumAddressTypes reports the local TCP/IP provider's required DPAID_INet.

2026-09-02: 512 -> 511. EnumLocalApplications validates its required
callback and reserved flags, then truthfully enumerates the browser Win98
machine's empty set of registered lobby-aware applications.

2026-09-02: 511 -> 502. Win32 DDEML now owns instance, copied HSZ,
registered-service, conversation and data-object state; invalid, stale and
cross-instance handles fail instead of fixed values succeeding silently.

2026-09-02: 502 -> 500. Begin/EndDeferWindowPos now allocate, validate,
consume and free real bounded HDWP transactions; queued geometry remains
unchanged until End applies it through the SetWindowPos behavior path.

2026-09-02: 500 -> 497. OpenClipboard/CloseClipboard now own an exclusive
USER transaction, and GetClipboardOwner reports ownership assigned by
EmptyClipboard instead of three fixed success/null answers.

2026-09-02: 497 -> 494. GetSubMenu now resolves real popup ownership,
ModifyMenu mutates dynamic items, and DrawMenuBar validates and redraws the
target window's non-client menu chrome instead of fixed success/handles.

2026-09-02: 494 -> 493. FindWindowA now searches the live top-level USER
tree by optional class atom/name and title instead of always returning NULL.

2026-09-02: 493 -> 491. SetPriorityClass/GetPriorityClass now validate the
emulated process handle and retain one shared Win98 priority class.

2026-09-02: 491 -> 489. GetThreadPriority/SetThreadPriority now validate
thread identity and retain the Win98 relative priority on the thread object.

2026-09-02: 489 -> 488. SetErrorMode now atomically replaces and returns the
shared Win98 x86 process error mode instead of always returning zero.

2026-09-02: 488 -> 483. COM/OLE initialization now owns per-thread apartment
model and nesting state; the dead duplicate OleInitialize body is gone.

2026-09-02: 483 -> 482. TranslateMessage now distinguishes the four
virtual-key messages from unrelated MSGs instead of always returning TRUE.

2026-09-02: 482 -> 480. SetThreadLocale and GetThreadLocale now retain real
per-thread LCID state and carry it into newly created threads.

2026-09-02: 480 -> 479. BringWindowToTop now changes sibling/top-level
z-order and activation state instead of reporting unconditional success.

2026-09-02: 479 -> 477. SetActiveWindow/GetActiveWindow now retain this
thread queue's active top-level and deliver real activation transitions.

2026-09-02: 477 -> 476. UnregisterClassA/W now remove the matching owned
class only after its last window is gone instead of always returning TRUE.

2026-09-02: 476 -> 473. Direct3D Device 1/2/3 GetStats now initializes all
five D3DSTATS counters and rejects a null output buffer.

2026-09-02: 473 -> 472. ImageList_Destroy now validates and invalidates its
handle and releases both the image-list record and retained icon array.

2026-09-02: 472 -> 471. CopyIcon now creates an independently owned copy of
bitmap-backed, resource-backed, and opaque system icon handles.

2026-09-02: 471 -> 470. CopyImage now owns and resamples bitmap/icon/cursor
images, including RETURNORG/DELETEORG, monochrome, and DIB-section requests.

2026-09-03: 470 -> 469. SHFileOperationA now delegates copy, move, rename,
wildcard, multi-destination, and recursive delete work to the shared VFS.

2026-09-03: 469 -> 468. FlushFileBuffers now validates a live writable VFS
file handle and reports access/handle errors instead of unconditional TRUE.

2026-09-03: 468 -> 469. Video for Windows added DrawDibOpen/Close (+2), while
GetLastActivePopup left the quiet inventory by retaining and validating
per-owner activation history (-1). The inventory records both changes.

2026-09-03: 469 -> 467. DrawDibOpen/Close now own, validate, invalidate and
free distinct opaque drawing contexts instead of returning constant success.

2026-09-03: 467 -> 466. GetLogicalDrives now queries the browser VFS's live
assignment mask instead of reporting a fixed C:/D: constant.

2026-09-03: 466 -> 463. SetFileApisToOEM/ANSI now propagate their process
code-page choice to Kernel32 filenames, and AreFileApisANSI reads it back
from the same process-shared VFS state across guest thread instances.

2026-09-03: 463 -> 462. DisableThreadLibraryCalls now validates loaded DLLs
and suppresses their future thread attach/detach notifications.

2026-09-03: 462 -> 461. WinExec now delegates the real command line and
nCmdShow to the browser child-launch path and returns its success/error code.

2026-09-03: 461 -> 460. GetWindowRgn now copies the window's retained USER
region into the caller's HRGN and returns its actual region complexity.

2026-09-03: 460 -> 459. FreeConsole now tears down the process console
window, buffers, input queue, aliases, and attachment state.

2026-09-03: 459 -> 458. SetConsoleCtrlHandler now owns a process handler
chain and delivers processed Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break events through guest callbacks.

2026-09-03: 458 -> 457. EnableScrollBar now retains per-window arrow state,
paints disabled arrows, and suppresses their input instead of always TRUE.

2026-09-03: 457 -> 456. OpenIcon now sends WM_QUERYOPEN and restores the
guest and browser window state instead of returning unconditional success.

2026-09-03: 456 -> 453. SetCapture/GetCapture/ReleaseCapture now validate
thread ownership and deliver synchronous WM_CAPTURECHANGED transitions.

2026-09-03: 453 -> 452. GetMapMode now reads canonical per-DC state.

2026-09-03: 452 -> 450. GetStockObject validates the Win98 selector set;
GetNearestColor now rejects invalid DCs instead of silently succeeding.

2026-09-03: 450 -> 449. GetTextCharset now reports selected font state.

2026-09-03: 449 -> 448. DestroyAcceleratorTable now validates repository
handles and releases only live tables instead of always returning success.

2026-09-03: 448 -> 447. SHBrowseForFolderA now runs a classic modal shell
tree and returns the selected PIDL instead of silently reporting Cancel.

2026-09-03: 447 -> 446. Shell_NotifyIconA now owns browser notification-
area add/modify/delete state and delivers Win98 mouse callback messages.

2026-09-04: 443 -> 442. GetClipboardSequenceNumber now reads the shared
window-station serial advanced by successful clipboard mutations.

2026-09-04: 442 -> 441. SetFileSecurityW now reports the Win98
ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED result instead of claiming an ACL was persisted.

2026-09-04: 441 -> 439. ExtractIconA and ExtractIconExA now enumerate and
materialize caller-owned PE/NE/ICO icons instead of returning fake success.

2026-09-04: 439 -> 438. GetForegroundWindow now queries renderer-wide
top-level z-order instead of returning this process's main HWND.

2026-09-05: 438 -> 437. The Win98 Shell32 ArrangeWindows ordinal now tiles
eligible renderer windows instead of returning an unconditional zero.

2026-09-06: 437 -> 435. Direct3D Device2/Device3 DeleteViewport now validate
ownership, clear current selection, and release attachment references.

2026-09-06: 435 -> 432. Direct3D Device 1/2/3 NextViewport now walks each
device's retained Win9x viewport list, returns AddRef'd HEAD/TAIL/NEXT
interfaces, and distinguishes invalid input, empty lists, and list end.

2026-09-10: 370 -> 369. mixerMessage now enforces the documented
device-id-only, MXDM_USER-or-higher contract and reports unsupported private
driver messages instead of claiming every driver-specific request succeeded.

2026-09-10: 369 -> 367. DPA_Destroy and DSA_Destroy now validate opaque live
handles, retire them, and return both their backing arrays and handle records
to the process heap instead of claiming success while leaking every array.

2026-09-10: 367 -> 365. Comctl32_Free and Comctl32_GetSize now operate on
validated live allocations instead of returning unconditional TRUE and 256;
the same tracked extent also makes ReAlloc preserve only owned bytes, retire
moved storage, and fail without destroying the original allocation.

2026-09-10: 365 -> 364. MenuHelp now uses its real seven-argument stdcall ABI,
resolves command and popup help-string resources, and drives the status bar's
separate Win98 simple pane instead of silently doing nothing.

2026-09-10: 364 -> 363. ShowHideMenuCtl now parses its documented selector
pairs, toggles the corresponding child or whole menu, synchronizes the menu
check, and fails for absent mappings or controls instead of always returning
TRUE.

2026-09-10: 405 -> 404. IDirectPlay3 Receive now reads its object's received
message queue, negotiates buffer size, filters sender/recipient, and supports
peek or consumption instead of unconditionally reporting no messages.
The reviewed inventory diff removes only this handler; no entries were added
or otherwise changed. Message production and DP4 activation remain separate.

2026-09-10: 404 -> 403. IDirectPlay3 Send now copies messages into local
recipient queues and signals their events, validates sender ownership and
unsupported modes, and rolls back partial multicast allocation failure.
The reviewed inventory diff removes only Send, with no added or modified
quiet entries. Network transport and asynchronous sending are not implemented.

2026-09-10: 356 -> 353. MonitorFromPoint, MonitorFromRect, and
MonitorFromWindow now test the one browser monitor's actual rectangle and
honor MONITOR_DEFAULTTONULL, MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY, and
MONITOR_DEFAULTTONEAREST instead of always returning the primary handle.
The same slice validates GetMonitorInfoA and makes its work area agree with
SPI_GETWORKAREA and the browser desktop's existing 28-pixel Win98 taskbar.

2026-09-11: 353 -> 348. DirectInput device Acquire, Unacquire,
SetDataFormat, SetCooperativeLevel, and Poll now follow the documented device
lifecycle instead of returning unconditional success. The device retains its
standard keyboard or mouse data format and cooperative-level HWND/flags;
acquisition is non-reference-counted, data access requires acquisition, and
invalid formats, windows, flag pairs, and acquired format changes return their
documented HRESULTs. The browser still exposes only the system keyboard and
mouse and does not yet model acquisition competition or automatic foreground
loss.

2026-09-11: 348 -> 346. RegisterDragDrop now validates a live process window,
rejects duplicate registrations, and retains one IDropTarget reference per
window. RevokeDragDrop distinguishes invalid and unregistered windows, unlinks
the exact registration, and releases its retained target. DLL-private targets
cross the existing suspended guest COM callback bridge for AddRef/Release;
emulator-local interfaces use the synchronous path. Browser drop events are not
yet converted into IDataObject/IDropTarget calls.

2026-09-11: 346 -> 345. CoLockObjectExternal now implements its documented
strong-reference lifetime: every lock owns one IUnknown AddRef and every
balanced unlock performs one Release. Repeated locks remain independently
counted, null and malformed interfaces fail before mutation, and an unbalanced
unlock returns E_UNEXPECTED. DLL-private implementations use the suspended
guest callback bridge; emulator-local objects complete synchronously. The
fLastUnlockReleases proxy-disconnection distinction is not observable because
the runtime does not expose out-of-process marshaled connections.

2026-09-11: 345 -> 344. CoSetState now retains the replacement thread-state
IUnknown before releasing the former object, while CoGetState returns an
independently AddRefed pointer. Both paths preserve the same ownership rules
for emulator-local and DLL-private guest implementations.
