# Win16 DDE incoming transaction ownership

2026-09-22: fixed two data-handle leaks in `win16_dde_deliver` on main.

The POKE/EXECUTE/ADVSTART branch used `select(data_take(...), 0, is_poke)`.
WebAssembly evaluates both operands: EXECUTE and ADVSTART allocated a handle
and discarded it. Sixteen transactions exhausted the entire data pool.
Separately, a POKE allocated data before attempting to enqueue its callback;
a full four-entry callback queue rejected the callback without freeing data.

Allocation is now conditional on POKE. Ownership transfers only when the
callback queue accepts it; rejection frees the newly allocated handle.
The existing callback completion path continues to reclaim accepted data.

`node test/test-win16-dde-data-ownership.js` calls the real frame delivery and
callback-completion helpers, with a seeded conversation. Before the fix it
reported 16 leaked handles for each non-data transaction kind, 16 live handles
for four queued POKEs, and 12 remaining after callback completion. After the
fix all pass, including payload bytes and 64 further POKE/reclaim cycles.

Fragment balance, API hash table, handler ESP/epilogue checks, test-tier
membership, whitespace, silent-stub pin (247 manual + 22 metadata), and
duplicate census (131 groups / 509 members) pass.

The broader `test-win16-dde-room.js` and `test-win16-dde-connect-callback.js`
both trap at connection setup, before this transaction branch. Repeating
each with only this fragment replaced in memory by its pre-change HEAD
contents reproduces the same `unreachable` stack (functions 8109, 8400, 776,
9863). Thus these suites are **not passing** in the shared worktree; the
failure is independent of this patch. No shared files were reverted for the
control runs. Investigating that connection-pump failure is a next candidate.

## Follow-up: connection-pump trap resolved

Compiling the same source closure with its diagnostic name section identified
the failing function as `win16_enter_wndproc`. The existing `DBG_INV=1` trace
showed a null procedure, window 15 and `WM_SIZE` immediately after the DDE
callback returned. `WIN16_DDE_CB` and `WIN16_CONT_CREATE_SIZE` both occupied
offset `0xFF80` in `WIN16_THUNK_SEL`; `win16_dispatch` handles the latter first.
It consequently interpreted a DDE return as a CreateWindow stack continuation.

Moved the DDE callback to the unused offset `0xFF84`. This changes only an
emulator-private return address, not the guest DDE API. The new
`test/test-win16-thunk-offsets.js` inspects the source manifest's constant
Win16 globals in the reserved `0xFF00..0xFFFF` range and rejects duplicate
offsets. It fails on the old collision and passes with 25 unique entries.
It is a unit regression, not a complete parser for arbitrary computed slot
definitions or an allocator for future continuation slots.

After this fix the real Win16 task/loopback tests pass: room routing 18/18,
connect callbacks and transactions 25/25. The earlier failure above is retained
as the investigation history, not the current outcome. No browser or native
Windows capture was needed to establish this internal address collision.

## Follow-up: one enqueue ownership rule for POKE and ADVDATA

The ADVDATA branch had the same rejected-queue leak as POKE. Extending the
ownership regression to frame type 10 reproduced 16 live handles for four
callbacks and 12 remaining after completion. The shared `ask_push_data` now
consumes its data handle on every call: accepted data remains owned by the
callback, rejected data is freed immediately. The previous POKE-only cleanup
was removed. All production callers were inspected: POKE and ADVDATA supply
freshly allocated blocks; the wrapper, XACT_COMPLETE and ADVREQ supply zero.

The expanded regression passes both frame types through queue saturation,
checks accepted payloads survive rejection, checks completion releases all
handles, then alternates 64 POKE/ADVDATA delivery/completion cycles. The real
Win16 callback/transaction suite remains 25/25 green. Fragment, test-tier and
silent-stub gates pass. Other agents' service/connection changes in this file
were not included in this fix. EXECUTE semantics, string ownership and malformed
frames remain separate review work; this does not claim all DDE lifetime paths
are now correct.

This is an internal ownership regression, not a native Win98 conformance
capture or an end-to-end Hearts gameplay claim. EXECUTE's existing callback
argument representation is unchanged and still needs separate review. Also
open: malformed frame lengths, pool exhaustion behavior, string-handle
ownership, other queue-producing branches, and eager-select trace reads.
