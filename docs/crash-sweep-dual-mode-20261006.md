# Dual-mode crash sweep, 2026-10-06

Every game has to work under the cooperative scheduler (`run.js --no-threads`,
the default) and with real guest threads (`run.js --threads`, the headless
twin of the browser's Threads mode). `tools/crash-sweep.js` now runs both and
compares them:

```sh
node tools/crash-sweep.js --apps=a,b,... --modes=coop,threads --seconds=15 \
  --stuck-after=0 --jobs=1 --jsonl=dual.jsonl
node tools/crash-sweep.js --compare --jsonl=dual.jsonl [--md] [--gate]
```

Each run records its signature (ok / unimpl / trap / exit / stuck / ...), the
final screen (`content` / `blank`, from the exit PNG) and the waveOut PCM
(`sound` / `silent` / `none`). `--compare` lists every app whose two modes
disagree, crash first, then early stop, then picture, then sound; `--gate`
exits 1 when any do.

Two things to know before reading a result:

- **Pass `--stuck-after=0`.** run.js ends a run as STUCK after 10 batches at
  one EIP. A loader whose main thread waits on worker threads does that within
  0.2 s, so with the default most 3D games "stuck" in both modes and look
  identical while nothing was compared. On this pass it turned 17 early stops
  into full runs and 4 apparent divergences into agreements.
- **Confirm a frame divergence before acting on it.** Worker scheduling is
  not deterministic: `red_alert_95_demo` ended on a blank frame under threads
  once and on the same 131,045-byte frame as coop on the repeat.
- **Audio is a weak signal headlessly**: `--audio-out` captures waveOut PCM
  only, so a DirectSound game reads `none` in both modes.

**Fixed:** `diablo_shareware` threw `ThreadManager.runSlice is the
cooperative backend` under `--threads` (cedede26): run.js called the inline
cooperative wait for a wait nested in a synchronous SendMessage, which the
worker backend cannot run. host.js already skipped it.

**Open divergences:**

1. `diablo_shareware`, threads: no trap any more, but the menu is Storm's
   dialog with plain Win32 buttons and the art is never drawn. Storm waits for
   its MPQ reader thread *inside* WM_INITDIALOG. Cooperatively the nested
   wait pumps that thread inline; under workers the wait answers "pending",
   the dialog procedure yields, and `$wnd_send_message` abandons it halfway
   (thread-manager.js's own comment on waitMultipleCooperative). host.js does
   the same in the browser's Threads mode, so the page should show the same
   menu. The fix is a blocking nested wait that services worker RPC until the
   object is signalled -- a worker-backend design change, not a one-liner.
2. `hype_glide_demo`, threads: `trap:unreachable`. MFC's thread at 0xb98b10
   (created suspended, then resumed) exits through EIP 0 still holding a
   critical section within ~1 s; under coop it stays alive. The main thread
   later reads a zeroed `m_hWnd` (`ShowWindow(0)`) and runs into 0x7525.

**Not run:** 230 registry apps. A boat fork has no `test/binaries` (30 GB,
gitignored, not in the snapshot) and run.js cannot mount app files from a
URL, so a full sweep on a boat needs a feed: a static server here, reverse
forwarded into the fork, and a tool that fetches each app's registry files
before its run.

## Follow-up (THREADS-DIVERGENCES-3): none of the three is a product bug

Checked in the page with Threads on (`tools/web-input-probe.js --threads`,
which serves COOP/COEP, so the guest main thread runs in a Worker):

- `diablo_shareware`: the Storm main menu with all its art
  (`scratch/runs/20261006T1400Z-threads-divergences/diablo-page-threads.png`).
- `hype_glide_demo`: the full Hype main menu (`hype-page-threads.png`).
- `red_alert_95_demo`: not a divergence at all -- three more CLI `--threads`
  runs ended on the same 131,045-byte frame as coop.

Diablo and hype fail only under **`run.js --threads`**, and the reason is the
harness, not the emulator: run.js keeps the guest main thread in-process,
while the browser's Threads mode runs it in a Worker. A wait the main thread
makes inside a synchronous SendMessage (Storm's MPQ reader inside
WM_INITDIALOG) can block in a Worker with `Atomics.wait` while the page
services the other threads' RPCs; in-process it cannot block, because the
threads it waits on need that same thread for their host imports, so it
answers "pending" and the dialog procedure is abandoned. Hype's loader thread
calls `exit()` (MSVCRT doexit, seen through 073ea677's EIP-0 registers) on the
CLI only; its root cause was not pinned, but the page runs it correctly.

So `--modes=coop,threads` on the CLI compares the cooperative scheduler with
**the CLI's** worker backend, which is not quite the browser's. A divergence
it finds is worth one page check (`web-input-probe --threads`) before it is
treated as a game bug. Making `run.js --threads` run the guest main thread in
a Worker would close that gap.

## Result: full registry, 271 apps, build 7b6a8cc0

Run on this box rather than a boat (the API key in use can `boat exec` but
not `ssh`/`forward`, so the reverse-forwarded feed could not be attached):

```sh
node tools/crash-sweep.js --all --modes=coop,threads --seconds=15 --stuck-after=0 \
  --jobs=1 --min-free-mb=1024 --no-build --jsonl=dual.jsonl
node tools/crash-sweep.js --compare --jsonl=dual.jsonl --md
```

542 runs, 14:25-16:38Z, with `--min-free-mb` holding the next run whenever
other sessions pushed available memory under 1 GB. Evidence:
`scratch/runs/20261006T1425Z-dual-mode-full/` (`dual.jsonl`, `sweep.log`,
`compare.md`, and the rerun below).

| signature | coop | threads |
|---|---|---|
| ok | 249 | 248 |
| missing-files (registry points at files not on this box) | 17 | 17 |
| exit (installers / apps that quit by themselves) | 4 | 4 |
| timeout (`windows_installer_20`) | 1 | 1 |
| trap | 0 | 1 (`hype_glide_demo`, the known CLI-only case above) |

**The two schedulers fail in exactly the same places.** Apart from Hype, every
crash, exit and timeout appears in both modes. 9 of the 271 apps disagree, and
8 of those disagree only on the final picture. Re-running those 8 once
(`rerun.jsonl`) cleared `ut2004_demo` (noise) and reproduced the other seven:

| app | coop | threads |
|---|---|---|
| deus_ex_demo, diablo_shareware, dungeons_of_dredmor_release, icy_tower, nfs2_demo | content | blank |
| dungeons_of_dredmor, tworld | no capture | content |

None of them crashes, exits or loses audio in either mode. Diablo is the case
already checked in the page above (the Threads page renders it; the blank is
the CLI's in-process main thread). The other six have not had that page check
yet and are the follow-up list, not bugs on their own. The two "no capture vs
content" rows go the other way: under coop the CLI found no surface to write
at exit.

## Fixed (HYPE-THREADS-CLI-TRAP): the CLI starved its own main thread

The one crash divergence above was the harness after all, but not where the
follow-up section guessed. `run.js --threads` gave every worker slice
`max(--batch-size × --thread-slices, 20000)` blocks against the main thread's
`--batch-size`, so a worker retired about 27 times the work main did per batch.
The page never runs that shape: `host.js` hands its main step count straight
to `runWorkerSlices`. Hype's loader thread then reached its sprite-row table
(`0x757200`) while main was still filling the 64K colour table beside it
(`0x466b4f`), followed a NULL row, and MSVCRT's `_XcptFilter` turned the fault
into `ExitProcess`. `--threads-serial` still failed, so it was never a parallel
race; `--thread-batch-size=1000` passed.

Workers now get `max(--batch-size, 1000)`, the browser's rule. A threads-mode
re-run of the 44 apps above (`scratch/runs/20261006T1715Z-threads-slice-parity/`):
40 unchanged, Hype reaches its main menu, `dungeons_of_dredmor_release` and
`ut2004_demo` now match their coop picture, `liquid_war` goes blank to content,
and nothing gained a crash, an exit or lost audio.

## October 7 reconciliation of later evidence

The 271-app table is the dated startup sweep, not an all-gameplay pass.
`e4145fe2` fixed the Hype CLI worker-slice mismatch; its 44-app rerun above
remains the supporting evidence. Later investigation of the picture-only
splits is retained in
`scratch/runs/20261006T1850Z-threads-picture-splits-w6/result.json`:

- Equal-batch CLI captures of icy_tower, deus_ex_demo and
  dungeons_of_dredmor_release agree; equal wall time captured different boot
  progress. NFS II reached its menu on the follow-up.
- The cooperative no-capture cases exhausted disk with PCM output before
  writing their PNGs. `e5dd0201` adds bounded audio capture and records batch
  counts; `f25d2208` repairs Range handling in the browser probe server.
- The retained page checks show Threads-on Deus Ex, Icy Tower and NFS II,
  plus cooperative Tile World and the Dredmor beta launcher. Dredmor release
  was not page-checked in that run. These are startup/rendering checks.

The old feed and CreatePipe prerequisites must not be reimplemented: the
feed and full sweep landed, and WinBoard now has real pipe/child support.
Browser gameplay, sound correctness beyond the limited sweep signal and
rows with missing fixtures remain separate obligations.

A read-only entrypoint audit on October 7 found 16 of the 17 previously
missing executable paths present in the current registry checkout. The one
absent entrypoint is
`test/binaries/candidates/baldurs-gate-interactive-demo/installed-extracted/MinimumData/BGDemo.exe`.
This checks file existence only, not dependencies or launch success; it does
not rewrite the dated sweep outcomes. Exact paths, sizes and registry hash:
