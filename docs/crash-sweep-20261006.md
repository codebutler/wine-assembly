# Registry crash sweep — 2026-10-06

Task `SWEEP-CRASHES-20261006` (claude:90024109). **Parked** 2026-10-06 03:15Z for
OPS-DASHBOARD-REDESIGN; resume from "Next" below.

## Method

`node tools/crash-sweep.js --all --no-build --seconds=15 --jsonl=<file>`: one
headless `test/run.js --app=ID --quiet-api --max-seconds=15` per `lib/apps.js`
id, strictly serial, classified from run.js's own output. Build: origin/main
`2dab0b06`, wasm md5 `6a92e26d…`. Raw results:
`scratch/runs/20261006T0220Z-crash-sweep/sweep.jsonl` (255 ids; the 22 ids
that first came back as instant `ok` were rerun after the classifier learned the
environment-gap classes, and the last line per id wins).

15 s of startup is all this sees: a crash past the first menu, or behind input,
is out of scope. `stuck` means run.js's idle detector ended the run (the app
was waiting for input), which is the normal state of a GUI app at rest.

## Ranked table

| # | signature | apps |
|---:|---|---|
| 160 | `ok` (still running at the deadline) | — |
| 79 | `stuck` (idle, waiting for input) | — |
| 4 | `exit:0` | write, welcome98, pocket_tanks_installer, icy_tower_installer |
| 4 | `missing-dep:skia-canvas` (box lacks the devDependency) | scr_corbis, scr_fashion, scr_horror, scr_wotravel |
| 3 | `trap:unreachable` | wep16_tetravex → **fixed**, nfs3_glide_demo, diablo2_glide_demo |
| 2 | `missing-files` (fixtures not on this box) | nfs2se_glide_demo, baldurs_gate_interactive_demo |
| 1 | `unimpl:CreatePipe` | winboard |
| 1 | `unimpl:DllRegisterServer` → **fixed** | explorer98 |
| 1 | `unimpl:PathAppendA` → **fixed** | dungeons_of_dredmor |

## Fixed

- **nfs3_glide_demo / diablo2_glide_demo** (cfdf0368, claude:202b4b39):
  the `$glide_record` → `$glide_fail` trap on a closed context. **Neither
  game draws before `grSstWinOpen`.** `--trace-api` shows both calling it
  (NFS III from its loader thread T1, Diablo II at API #15476) and getting 0:
  under the default `--glide-renderer=webgl`, `test/run.js` gave the Glide
  bridge no canvas (`ctx.createCanvas` stays null unless `--headless-gl`, for
  GL/D3D9's sake), so `lib/glide-host.js` never reached its WebGL→software
  fallback. The games ignore the failed open, and their next `grBufferClear` /
  `guGammaCorrectionRGB` trapped. The fix is `ctx.glideCreateCanvas`, Glide's
  own drawable factory. NFS III Glide now reaches the race and Diablo II its
  main menu headless (`scratch/runs/20261006T040500Z-glide-winopen-cli*`).
  The closed-context trap stays: a draw after a *failed* open is still
  an emulator gap worth failing on. Pinned by `test/test-glide-webgl-fallback.js`.
- **dungeons_of_dredmor** (Steam beta): `PathAppendA` (api 4102), then
  `PathFileExistsA` (api 4103), both over the existing W cores. Reaches its
  launcher: `scratch/runs/20261006T0305Z-dredmor-beta-path-apis` (reviewed).
  Commits 0c9cd8c9, 148ea318.

- **wep16_tetravex**: Tetravex hands every WM_PAINT to DefWindowProc. The
  shared `$defwndproc_paint_erase` allocated a transient DC and sent
  WM_ERASEBKGND with it, but a 16-bit procedure cannot be entered from inside
  that call, so the send was queued and the DC released before delivery. The
  procedure got a dead DC (the board never drew) and narrowing it took a new
  Win16 handle-map slot per paint until `$win16_h16` trapped at batch 20311.
  Win16 procedures now get the window's synthetic client DC (hwnd+0x40000), as
  the Win16 pending-erase path already does. Board renders, 30000 batches
  clean: `scratch/runs/20261006T0400Z-wep16-tetravex-handle-map`;
  `test/test-win16-defwndproc-paint-dc.js`.

- **explorer98**: Explorer does LoadLibraryA("ACTXPRXY.DLL"), which no file
  provides, so LoadLibrary's last fallback returned the image base, and
  GetProcAddress(DllRegisterServer) on it fell through to the API-by-name
  thunk, our fail-fast handler. GetProcAddress now answers NULL /
  ERROR_PROC_NOT_FOUND for DllRegisterServer/DllUnregisterServer on that
  pseudo-module (the EXE's own export table is still searched first). 30 s
  clean with the desktop and taskbar: `scratch/runs/20261006T0405Z-explorer98-dllregisterserver`;
  `test/test-getprocaddress-sparse-name.js`.

## Open, with what is known

- **WinBoard follow-up resolved on October 6:** the CreatePipe row above is
  historical. Real anonymous pipes, inherited child standard handles and
  process support landed; the original GNUChess responds to an ordinary human
  move. The later Threads-on browser capture shows `1.e4 e6` with no stale e2
  pawn (`2dab96f8`, `scratch/runs/20261006T1420Z-winboard-web-threads/result.json`).
  Do not restart the removed CreatePipe prerequisite from the early sweep.
- `exit:0` rows were not reviewed; installers exiting 0 at startup may be
  legitimate (already-installed checks).
