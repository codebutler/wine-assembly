# D3D backend coverage: what actually draws on each backend, 2026-09-20

First pass at the D3D backlog item "gameplay captured on both rendering
backends". Its job is *coverage*, not agreement: which apps put a 3D frame on
the screen when the GPU path draws, which do it on the software path, and which
do neither — with the picture as the oracle, not a draw counter.

All headless CLI, no browser. Captures in `build/d3d-backend-coverage/`
(gitignored), named `<app>-<mode>-canvas.png` (the composited screen, what a
user sees) and `<app>-<mode>-surface.png` (the DirectX surface `--png` prefers).

## The two backends, and what "gpu" and "software" mean here

Two unrelated control surfaces, unified in `index.html`'s `D3D_MODES` into one
dropdown (`webgl`, `webgl-all`, `software`):

| family | browser knob | CLI, gpu arm | CLI, software arm |
|---|---|---|---|
| DX2-7 (D3DIM), `lib/d3dim-gpu.js` | `window.WINE_D3DIM_GPU` | `--headless-gl --d3dim-gpu` | *(no flags)* |
| D3D8/9, `lib/d3d9-host.js` | `window.WineD3D.renderer` | `--headless-gl` | `--d3d9-renderer=software` |

`--d3d9-renderer=webgl` is rejected by `test/run.js`; `--headless-gl` is how the
CLI reaches the WebGL D3D9 backend.

**`--headless-gl` needs a live display.** `caffeinate -u` alone is not enough —
two runs in this sweep died with `No suitable display found for a new GLFW
Window` → `*** CRASH: WebGL is unavailable` from `D3DIMGpu._target`. Hold the
display with `nohup caffeinate -d -u -t 2400 &` and re-run; both then passed.
A GPU-arm crash inside `d3dim-gpu.js` is this environment failure until the
`[gl] ... GLFW sees ZERO displays` line is ruled out.

## Results

`gameplay` = a live 3D scene reached through an input route. `menu` = a real
screen but not gameplay. `blank` = the window draws no geometry at all.

| app | family | gpu | software | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **mw3** (MechWarrior 3 demo) | D3DIM | **gameplay** | **gameplay** | both reach the cockpit; terrain hue differs (see below) |
| **gta2_demo** | D3DIM | **gameplay** | **gameplay** | Wild Demo playfield on both; GPU arm is visibly smoother |
| **mcm** (Motocross Madness trial) | D3DIM | **gameplay** | **gameplay** | live race on both; GPU arm filters the terrain texture |
| **pawn** (Pawn 3 chess) | D3D9 | **gameplay** | **CRASH** | see the Pawn row below |
| dx_boids | D3DIM | blank | blank | 84,869 GPU draws / 5.7M triangles and the frame is **one colour** |
| dx_flip3dtl | D3DIM | blank | blank | 115,686 GPU draws; frame is black + a yellow text overlay |
| dx_twist | D3DIM | blank | blank | draws=0 both arms; black + fps text |
| dx_tunnel | D3DIM | blank | blank | draws=0 both arms; black + fps text |
| dx_globe | D3DIM | blocked | blocked | modal `Failed to load sphere3.x / D3DRMERR_BADFILE`, then STUCK |
| dx_viewer | D3DIM | blocked | blocked | modal `Failed to load camera.x / D3DRMERR_BADFILE`, then STUCK |

### Differences between the backends, measured

Pixel-diff percentages at tolerance 0 are meaningless on a textured 3D scene —
every 565 rounding step counts. Each row below is quoted at `--tolerance=32`
beside that app's own null band (the same arm run twice), which is the only
scale that makes the number readable.

| app | backend diff (tol=32) | null band (tol=32) | what changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| mw3 | **4.07%** | 0.026% | terrain is **green** on software, **brown/tan** on GPU; sky and HUD agree |
| gta2_demo | **1.59%** | **0.000%** (bit-identical rerun) | glyph and sprite edges; GPU arm smoother |
| mcm | **1.39%** | not measured (see below) | terrain texture filtering: blocky/dithered on software, smooth on GPU |

For MCM the null band was not run (the route is ~185,000 batches), but the two
arms' batch-60000 loading-screen captures are **bit-identical** (0 of 307200
pixels differ), which is strong evidence the route itself is deterministic and
the 1.39% at batch 185000 is the backends disagreeing.

MW3's is the one that looks like a bug rather than a filtering choice: the same
terrain texture comes out a different hue, not a different sharpness.

### Pawn: the D3D9 software backend crashes

Pawn plays on the GPU arm — the e-pawn drag lands, the engine replies, and the
yellow last-move outline is in the capture. On `--d3d9-renderer=software` it
gets a device, clears, presents once, and then:

```
[API] IDirect3DSurface9_GetDC
[1658] EIP=0x075030d8 EAX=0x8876086c ...
[API] IDirect3DSurface9_GetDC
[eip-zero] guest called through NULL at batch 1764
  dbg_prev_eip=0x0041c100
```

`EAX=0x8876086c` is `D3DERR_INVALIDCALL`: the second
`IDirect3DSurface9::GetDC` on the back buffer fails, Pawn calls through the
NULL HDC it gets back, and the guest dies at `0x0041c100`. The window is left
showing its caption and menu over an empty grey client area
(`pawn-software-canvas.png`). Adding `--d3d9-programmable` changes nothing.
Pawn draws its whole board through that `GetDC`, so this is the one call that
has to work for it.

## Repro commands

Every run: `--no-build`, `--quiet-api`, `--no-close`, an explicit
`--max-seconds`. GPU arms need `nohup caffeinate -d -u -t 2400 &` first.

## What this contradicts in the 2026-09-19 sweep

[docs/d3dim-gl-sweep-2026-09-19.md](d3dim-gl-sweep-2026-09-19.md) is not wrong
about its own arms; it is measuring something narrower than its table reads as.

1. **"dx_boids / dx_flip3dtl IDENTICAL, 0% diff" is two blank screens agreeing.**
   Measured here with `tools/png-inspect.js stats`: dx_boids' composited frame
   is **one distinct colour** (`#000c18`, 307200 px) on *both* backends, while
   the GPU executor reports 84,869 draws and 5,760,818 triangles. dx_flip3dtl is
   two colours — black plus its yellow text overlay — with 115,686 GPU draws.
   The triangles are being drawn and never reach anything the user sees. An
   IDENTICAL verdict on a one-colour frame is not evidence of agreement, and
   this is the largest thing the sweep's diff-only method cannot see.
2. **"mcm NODRAW" was a modal, not an absence of 3D.** MCM greets a fresh
   profile with a "we must now test your video memory" MessageBox; a startup
   slice never gets past it. `200:dlg-cmd:1` plus the re-note's route reaches a
   **live race on both backends**. Same for `mw3`, which the sweep scored
   IDENTICAL from a menu and which actually disagrees by 4.07% at gameplay.
3. **"eleven of sixteen never drew a triangle" is the right headline but the
   wrong diagnosis for at least two of them.** dx_globe and dx_viewer do not
   fail to draw — they die on a modal `D3DRMERR_BADFILE` (`sphere3.x`,
   `camera.x`) and then STUCK in a thunk. That is the known `.x` file loader
   asset gap, not a renderer question, and no budget or route fixes it.
4. **The sweep's headline number for GTA2 was menu text; at gameplay it is
   1.59% at tol=32 against a bit-identical null band.** Both arms show the Wild
   Demo playfield, so this is a fidelity difference, not a coverage one.

## Blocked, and why

- **dx_globe, dx_viewer** — `D3DRMERR_BADFILE` on `sphere3.x` / `camera.x`.
  Asset/`.x`-loader gap (see the `dx_viewer` note in the DX re-notes), identical
  on both backends. Not a backend question until the loader lands.
- **dx_boids, dx_flip3dtl, dx_twist, dx_tunnel** — no geometry reaches the
  composited frame on either backend, so there is nothing to compare. Worth
  chasing on its own: for boids and flip3dtl the executor *is* drawing, so the
  loss is between the render target and the primary, not in either rasterizer.
- **pawn on software** — crashes (above). The GPU arm is the only D3D9 gameplay
  capture in this sweep.
- **black_white_2_demo** — the only other D3D9 title in the registry. Not
  attempted: `docs/re-notes/black-white-2.md` already records that it does not
  reach gameplay, so it cannot produce a gameplay row on either backend yet.
- **darkstone_demo, heroes3_demo, jazz2_demo, aoe2, captain_claw_demo, spider,
  pocket_tanks, halflife_uplink, deus_ex_demo** — not covered here. Each needs
  either a multi-minute `--control-stdin` route (darkstone) or is a 2D
  DirectDraw title whose D3DIM draw count was already zero; both are a second
  pass, not a budget increase. deus_ex_demo ships configured for
  `SoftDrv.SoftwareRenderDevice`, so it is not a D3D backend comparison at all.

## Method notes worth keeping

- `--png` prefers a DirectX surface over the composited desktop and will show a
  perfect 3D frame while the window is empty grey (that is exactly Pawn's old
  failure mode). The `N:png:FILE` **input action** always captures the
  composited screen, so one run yields both: `--png=…-surface.png` plus
  `--input=N:png:…-canvas.png`. Where the two differ, the canvas is the honest
  one. In this sweep they agreed for every app that drew.
- Judge "did it draw" with `node tools/png-inspect.js stats <png>` — distinct
  colour count — before reading any diff percentage. `--dx-surfaces`'s
  `colors=` column is *sampled* and reported 1 for frames that turned out to be
  genuinely uniform, but it is a sample, not a census.
- Diff a textured 3D frame at `--tolerance=32` and always alongside that app's
  own null band. At tolerance 0, MW3's software arm differs from *itself* by
  33%.
