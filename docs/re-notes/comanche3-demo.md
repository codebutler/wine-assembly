# Comanche 3 DOS demo: native installer evidence

## Normal registered dashboard launch, 2026-10-08

Title `comanche3-demo` now uses the normal DOS/ToyVM dashboard catalog,
`/toyvm/?title=comanche3-demo`, title API and pinned eleven-file manifest.
Durable originals live in gitignored
`test/binaries/toyvm-installed/comanche3-demo/`; every size/SHA is pinned in
`test/toyvm-dos-corpus/titles.json`. Original exports remain unchanged.
There is no existing candidate provenance entry, so candidateId stays null.

`scratch/runs/20261008T1323Z-comanche3-registered-launch/` records one ordinary
Start showing original Comanche3 copyright text and ordinary Stop,16.837seconds.
Actual CPU917477/bundle53a1d9 and44 source/font pins match accepted flight.
The separate sealed flight result below remains unchanged and explicitly
associated with this ToyVM title; DOSBox evidence is independent.
Reviewed flight covers the recorded build/keyboard route only. FPS unknown,
audio disabled; combat/mission completion/saves remain unqualified.

for tests, exact identity, limits and verified remote cleanup.

## Original cockpit and controlled flight, 2026-10-08

On explicit integrated source `4280b855d`, one user-authorized longer browser
window reaches the original cockpit and ordinary forward flight plus a directed
right bank. Shared evidence:
`scratch/runs/20261008T1012Z-comanche3-flight-window/`.
The actual dashboard page/input wiring uses a private localhost fixture serving
the eleven preserved installed originals; no production catalog/deploy claim.

Reviewed `retrieved/original/canvas-cockpit-before.png` shows heading243,
ALT2/SPEED0/TORQUE1 at the start point. Normal reference-card controls6/E/0,
Up and Right produce `canvas-forward-flight.png` heading244/ALT10/SPEED5 and
`canvas-turn-right.png` heading250/ALT41/SPEED17 with banked terrain and
shifted radar-dish/building/windsock landmarks. Final `screen-001-final.png`
shows heading267/ALT95/SPEED13. This qualifies the scoped original cockpit,
flight and input goal; no combat/mission completion/save/FPS/audio claim.

Known ready-screen route: Escape skips intro, two Down select Argon, then five
Enter transitions reach Gallant Venture/Haystack/briefing/map/loading. No
input during loading; no guest state, code, clock, BIOS or transition forcing.
Sparse pure-JS observations show original LZW/caching, mission blend under
`cb31c -> 67907 -> 2dd58`, later `67947`, then `cb33a` assets. At10:49:02
the original tick wait returns to `cb3e7`;10:49:52 rendering returns to
`cb45c` inside the mission loop following `cb403`. Prior loading windows
ended during advancing initialization; no menu/loader repair was needed.

## Disabled detector candidate, 2026-10-08

Separate optimization `perf/toyvm-disabled-progress-20261008`, explicit base
`7dd9b0e8f538dfdb514d16cc3d39478cf6bdb959`, skips diagnostic work inside
`DosSession.checkProgress` when the detector is disabled. Real execution
regressions prove zero diagnostic register/console work, full guest-memory and
exported-getter equivalence, and unchanged enabled progress/spin/refusal behavior.
Both bundles are reproducible. Root review/integration is pending.

Evidence: `scratch/runs/20261008T0911Z-toyvm-disabled-progress/`; handoff
[`toyvm-disabled-progress-20261008.md`](../../ops/handoffs/toyvm-disabled-progress-20261008.md).
Six alternating pairs of the original early startup prefix match memory SHA,
reported registers and counters; median paired elapsed reduction14.87% applies
only to that250,366-dispatch prefix. A separate BIOS no-op handback stress loop
is explicitly excluded from useful-work qualification. Exact CPU917477 is
unchanged, with control/candidate V8 and SpiderMonkey x64 native captures plus
actual Node host-path review. Standalone V8 capture differs from the benchmark
engine; timed tiers are adaptive. No ARM, loading-speed or gameplay claim.

One finite candidate original run again reaches the ordinary Argon/Haystack
briefing/map/loading route. Live C2M1_C.PCX output250,215 matches the independent
original reference; temporary file reaches5,242,880bytes. All60 sampled code
spans match original and12 window reads preserve exported getters. Final
original2db40 sample has possible validated near-call returns2a6cb/2f4ac/cb317;
the prior later palette milestone and cb403 mission loop are not claimed.
At the unchanged prelaunch deadline, normal host stop ends1771.587wall /
130.3641804guest seconds with reviewed loading art, no cockpit or controlled
flight. No extra Enter during loading, entry/profiling hook or guest state
forcing. Cleanup29.029seconds,89retrieved files verified before prefix removal,
19owned PIDs absent/no Chrome/exact baseline sockets/16immutable pins unchanged.

## Authenticated resource and palette progress, 2026-10-08

On explicit `83ef822fb4204145b642c507918739ba7c1626d5`, one fresh private
dashboard fixture launch reaches Haystack loading using ordinary keyboard
press/release. No extra Enter is sent during loading. No cockpit, controlled
flight, or generic repair is established.

Evidence: `scratch/runs/20261008T0806Z-comanche3-resource-loading/`.
Original decoded resource/refill spans match the saved mapping. Shared LZW
decoder `27567` completes on EDI ≥ `[8aa8]` or token `101`, frees at `2763d`,
and returns at `27649`. LZR1 uses a length header; LZP1 uses width × height.
RESOURCE2xxx's2,234 directory records decode filenames with XOR `aceddead`.
Live output windows match independent original-algorithm decodes at M.PCX
650341bytes and C.PCX667693bytes. Temporary output reaches5,242,880bytes.

Final coherent RAM/stack authenticates `cb317` → `67907` → `2dd58` → `2dac0`:
the original65,536-entry palette blend table. Its loop ordinal advances
1287 →3566 →12922; later stack returns identify next palette phase `2f72d`.
Six nearest-color code differences are original RGB immediate writes, verified
against the original writer and live components. This is causal original work,
not an established stall or complete trace authentication.

The fresh run has no onEntry hook. Pure JS sparse reads and the coherent final
44,302,336-byte snapshot preserve RAM and exported getters exactly. Two unpaired
JS profiles show frequent host handbacks, progress-check/resolver/framebuffer
cost; they do not qualify an optimization. Late memory serialization costs
about32wall seconds. No guest RAM/register/instruction forcing is used.

Actual Chrome151/tailcall386/paced10MIPS/JIT-off/silent CPU917477 runs
1722.999wall/123.5675099guest seconds and stops before its fixed08:39:30Z
deadline. All24 runtime images are reviewed as startup/menu/briefing/map/loading.
All86 retrieved root hashes,18 pins,13 absent owned PIDs, no Chrome and baseline
sockets are verified before prefix removal; cleanup39.263seconds. Prior1541
indexed hashes remain unchanged. FPS/audio remain unknown. Root owns the boat
lease and integration. See the resource-loading handoff for the exact identities,
limitations and next causal initialization/cost measurement.

## Authenticated Haystack selection and loading, 2026-10-08

Current clean source `249b2d3986f9992d7432717acc61614f58653d1b` reaches
Haystack briefing, map, and “Downloading Mission Parameters…” using public
browser keyboard input and the original installed files. No cockpit or ordinary
player-controlled flight was observed. No generic engine repair is justified.
The held-key lifecycle and BIOS mirror policy remain unchanged.

Evidence: `scratch/runs/20261008T0718Z-comanche3-haystack-selection/`.
Original executable loader decryption authenticates live CS2b code at virtual
base `0x10000000`: hardware reader `86cc`, queue consumer `80fe`, and menu
consumer `68559`/Enter comparison `685a3`. Haystack dispatch has 321/321 exact
original decoded instruction-byte matches and returns `c2m1` through `2450c`.
The resource menu also names `Haystack~c2m1`. This supersedes the previous
unmapped hardware-reader receipt without inventing a selection cause.

Original French manual printed20 documents roster Up/Down+Enter; printed65–67
documents briefing/map Next. Reviewed screen044 is the mission briefing;
`canvas-mission-map.png` is the map; final captures remain loading art.
Resource reads and a guest-created temporary file continue changing during
loading. This does not authenticate a stall, duplicate-input cause, or bottleneck.

One Chrome151/tailcall386/paced10MIPS/JIT-off/silent private dashboard fixture
run lasted1773.004 wall seconds/140.186625 guest seconds under one deadline.
Initial port observer used a reader that can update paging Accessed bits;
strict preservation before its correction is not established. Later pure JS
observer reads preserve full RAM/registers; viewport helper corrections are
recorded. Cleanup completed92.489 seconds, exceeding allowance by2.489.
See `ops/handoffs/comanche3-haystack-selection-20261008.md` for limitations
and the next bounded causal investigation. No production deployment claim.

## Web held keyboard repair and operation menu, 2026-10-08

Generic web lifecycle repair `4a75293a249b0968e50e4a8bb61cf9ed4963624e`
separates physical press/release/repeat from existing tap callers, with shared
browser blur/visibility/stop cleanup. Real API/IRQ/port/BIOS tests and full build
pass; old immediate-break and physical keypad mapping failures are retained.

Shared `scratch/runs/20261008T0636Z-toyvm-held-key-web/` contains one original
C3 browser launch on fresh no-env bx_vv2g89ek, actual Chrome151/tailcall386/
CPU917477, eleven verified installed files, actual dashboard page/wiring with
an explicitly private catalog/file fixture bootstrap. Ordinary Puppeteer
keyboard.down/up visibly moves Blood Hawk013 to Venom016/017 while held;
actual E0/50 then later E0/d0 port reads retained. Release018 and later020
remain Venom. Repeat adds make only; ordinary focus loss and Stop clear held
state. All55 images reviewed. No guest register/memory/instruction mutation.

039 shows Argon Duty Roster;040 at06:55:11 shows Gallant Venture's Haystack
mission menu **before** later Up at06:55:50. Enter attempts there leave the
menu visible; no mission/cockpit/gameplay/FPS/audio qualification or causal
native menu-return diagnosis. BIOS mirroring is preserved; retained entries
and hooked INT9/hardware reads do not prove a BIOS-mirroring cause. Final
Enter port read receipt CS2b/rawGIP86cc is not yet mapped to the original
operation-selection consumer.

Browser used the initial held-lifecycle bundle. Final physical event.code/
keypad mapping and modifier-only BIOS-wait guard were corrected after launch,
pass actual regressions/full build, and were not original-media browser rerun.
Both closures and hashes are retained; no production dashboard/deploy claim.

## Installed C3 launch and physical input, 2026-10-08

On explicit `cdddc109b87c02f2a683c08da731e585a56fd614`, a single native
`runDos` launch from eleven SHA-verified preserved installed files reaches
copyright, animated Dolby intro, Pilot Roster and Duty Roster for Venom,
Blood Hawk and Argon. No installer/Setup replay, snapshot, guest instruction,
register or clock forcing. CPU module remains `91747769679ce2e661242d0777c1f0fb5aeffe48cbbe2f71ea9443eaf57a45cf`;
the DOS JS includes main's rename plus host-shadow guard.

Shared self-contained evidence:
`scratch/runs/20261008T0551Z-comanche3-installed-gameplay/`. Reviewed
`screen-014.png` → `screen-034.png` shows ordinary held Down moving Blood Hawk
to Venom; Duty Roster is reviewed in048/104/150/155. Battle artwork044 is not
gameplay. Actual port60 make/break logs and read-only BIOS buffer observations
are retained. Native short taps often show no clear response; held inputs
do produce menu interaction, but Up sometimes redraws a Pilot Roster background
after Duty Roster. Operation-selection state, timing, BIOS mirroring and
rendering causes remain unresolved. No cockpit, flight response or generic
repair established. C3.SAV32/C3.NAM1674 guest-created files are preserved.

The actual run ended by an explicit host diagnostic stop before its unchanged
06:20:48.657 deadline,1546.31884wall/146.88242guest seconds,
1470819156dispatches, clean child0 but guest not exited. No CPU faults or
unimplemented instructions. Optional calls2f:16/15:c0/10:4f remain recorded;
exact VBE subfunctions unknown. SETUP.CFG miss does not prove a blocker.
182actual files38098701bytes retrieved and SHA checked;86pins unchanged,

`bx_698xwqef`, expiry06:30:25.015; no owned execution remains.

Root board06:02 reserves the web press/release and blur/stop repair: current
`LiveRun.key` sends immediate make+break through `pushKey`, so the held native
input is not yet a qualified web route. No overlapping source edit made.
Next: implement/validate that lifecycle, then authenticate C3's actual operation
selection and cockpit/control response using the preserved installed files.
No FPS/audio/performance claim. Exact source/input receipts, corrections and
limitations are in [the installed-launch handoff](../../ops/handoffs/comanche3-installed-gameplay-20261008.md).

## Native full copy and generic rename repair, 2026-10-08

The fresh continuation on explicit base
`73e7025e696dda27fbe2c3ed36511b41aa04b9ee` reached 100% file copy and the
reviewed **Installation Complete** prompt. Ordinary Enter then failed with
**File not found: setup.exe**. This is a demonstrated DOS file-service gap,
not a timeout or an established interpreter bottleneck. The earlier corrected
3% run executed only235.9166seconds; it did not spend900seconds copying.

Passive original-media control captures actual DOS return `0540:4c81`, AH56h,
source `C:\C3DEMO\INSTALL.TMP`950891bytes, destination
`C:\C3DEMO\SETUP.EXE`, after the real close. The handler returnedfalse and
left the temporary record unchanged. Actual caller authentication:
INSTALL.BIN inner MZ053d/image05ed/originalCS0385 yields original `CD21` at
IP4c7f, returning4c81. The control stops deliberately after that call by a
bounded observer exception; no guest binary/register edit or CPU trap is
claimed. Receipt and original48byte span are in
`scratch/runs/20261008T0515Z-comanche3-rename-control/`.

The generic AH56 repair renames closed guest-created records on mounted C
within the same directory, retains exact bytes/identity, and removes the old
name. It refuses missing files, collisions, readonly/hidden/system records,
open sources, readonly corpus sources, other drives, wildcards and unsupported
directory moves. Existing basename lookup remains; there is no directory-tree
or host-write claim. Original DOS reference:
https://www.pcjs.org/documents/books/mspl13/msdos/dosref40/ (Function56H).

The real-handler regression fails before and passes13groups afterward;
synthetic native create/write/close/rename/open-old-fails/open-new/read/exit
passes all four interpreter variants on the temporary box. Existing temp-file,
EXEC environment/boundary/resident and MCB contracts, regenerated browser
bundle reproducibility, test tiers and whitespace checks pass. No interpreter
optimization or performance benchmark was made.

The repaired original installer now preserves actual SETUP.EXE950891bytes,
C3.EXE945297bytes and RESOURCE.RES55496696bytes. After reviewed100%/Installation
Complete and ordinary Enter, the wrapper successfully opens the installed
SETUP.EXE and reaches **Loading Setup ...**, then the reviewed graphical
**Testing Your CD-ROM Transfer Rate / Performing test, please wait** screen.
No input was sent to that wait screen. Final capture is black at the unchanged
wall cap; Setup completion/gameplay are unverified. All11 actual generated
records are retained through the supported file export, with named hashes in
`20261008T0520Z-comanche3-rename-repaired/installed-files.json`. No VM checkpoint
or game run exists. The captured installation blocker is repaired for root
review. Root's05:43UTC extra host-shadow case exposes the old corpus basename
after renaming a guest record that shadows it; root owns a fail-closed guard
and regression before main integration. Actual INSTALL.TMP has no host
collision. No additional worker runtime is authorized by that review.

Evidence: shared `scratch/runs/20261008T0505Z-comanche3-install-progress/`
(original full-copy failure and30second actual copying profile),

This is the original Comanche 3 demo DOS media, distinct from Comanche Gold. Original directory: `test/binaries/win98-games-a-d/Commanche3-demo-SW`. INSTALL.EXE is 2,462 bytes (SHA-256 5a5ff6d376642d83ac9b049be952c64deb8898d09b593a0fb90083fed26e9cbb); INSTALL.BIN is 58,119,069 bytes (2bc752ed8feada4f33c78d73e6f036f935f6903af71513bb9fdeb808e138ccf8). No DOSBox substitution or installer autoanswers were used.

## Native probe, 2026-10-07

Source snapshot a2816e17664fa165520ad2e7b80cef7c3daa22d7; run artifacts are in `scratch/wt-diehard-20261007/scratch/comanche3-preparation/native-attempt1/` (identity, raw log/result, installer.png, cleanup and validation.json hash closure). Start 12:21:54.589Z, terminal 12:21:55.335Z; driver 2643693 and child 2643700 absent after cleanup, streams closed, original five media hashes unchanged.

The personally reviewed screenshot displays “Fatal error, insufficient conventional memory” and the wrapper's unknown-error message. That text is an observed installer error, **not proof of insufficient host or guest capacity**. INSTALL.BIN exited 1; its INSTALL.EXE wrapper subsequently exited 0. The supervisor PASS denotes clean harness termination only. No generated files, installer completion, game scene, player input, audio or FPS were established.

## Discriminating source finding

The trace loads INSTALL.BIN at PSP 019a, entry 01aa:0154. That child then opens C:\INSTALL.EXE, reads its six-byte header, seeks to 099e (the 2,462-byte parent's EOF), and receives zero-byte reads before the error. This identifies the wrong self-file lookup as an actionable lead; later extender support remains untested.

In tools/toyvm/dos.js, installEnvironment (around1176–1222) emits the environment variables, double NUL, count word1 and top-level C:\INSTALL.EXE path. EXEC AH4B (around4514–4628) reads only command-tail fields at parameter-block offsets2/4; it ignores the environment selector at offset0. The child PSP:2c is assigned the same fixed ENV_SEG (0060), retaining the parent's executable-name trailer. The same defect is present in origin/main c1ae54312dfe79fd3e667dbb02d70f61a42f2c2f at this audit.

A safe generic repair must copy the selected environment variables (zero selector inherits from parent PSP; nonzero chooses supplied segment), construct the executed child's canonical program-name trailer, allocate an owned nonoverlapping DOS block, and preserve parent bytes. It must not rewrite the global parent trailer or hardcode INSTALL.BIN. Existing memAlloc/mcbOwner/child termination ownership and load-only AL1 must be considered: ordinary AH4C frees child-owned blocks, while resident AH31 preserves ownership. Current mcbSync roots at the initial PSP, so child environment placement must be represented in memBlocks rather than an untracked gap.

Proposed discriminating regression: invoke real EXEC handling on synthetic parent/child files and parse child PSP:2c bytes; verify inherited/explicit variables, exact child path, parent immutability, nested EXEC, AL1 load-only, child exit cleanup, resident ownership, allocation failure rollback and nonoverlap with image/adjacent canaries. A child that opens its own environment trailer should read child bytes, not parent's EOF. Preserve this baseline failure before any repair; rerun the original installer only after focused tests and a runtime grant. No repair or retry is included in this finding.

## Private EXEC and MCB candidate, 2026-10-07 13:10Z

The isolated candidate now clones the selected environment for each child and tracks its ownership, preserves resident descendant images across ancestor exit, and corrects the MCB chain's next-data-segment boundary. The intermediate candidate exposed a second real issue: a resize rebuilt the next MCB header inside the environment's final paragraph, turning the intended child path into `C:\IZ`. The original installer filename-reader disassembly at CS:0287–02af follows PSP:2c, scans the double NUL, skips the count word, and calls DOS open normally. Source-derived environment reconstruction predicted that corruption; it was not a captured guest memory dump. An actual AH4A handler regression then reproduced it and passed with the boundary correction.

Final private `dos.js` SHA-256: `31758370d35247d65f2c66826eacfe67bbd0d6b4282bc46d7699a15cdc664613`, based on main `c1ae54312dfe79fd3e667dbb02d70f61a42f2c2f`. Twenty pure-JS actual-handler groups pass. Preserved controls show the wrong-parent path, COM allocation NaN, actual replacement-image overwrite of resident bytes, and environment corruption. The unchanged actual native `test-toyvm-dos-terminate.js` passed `SDT` on this final candidate in 710ms; its process group closed normally. These are scoped contracts, not a general DOS compatibility qualification.

The separately bounded original installer run started 13:10:19.195Z and closed 13:10:19.867Z. Driver2697860/child2697869 terminated, both streams closed, process group absent, original five media hashes unchanged. It now opens **`C:\INSTALL.BIN`**, passing the earlier self-file failures. The reviewed screen instead says **“Insufficient extended memory to run program”**, followed by the wrapper's missing `setup.exe` error. INSTALL.BIN exits1; INSTALL.EXE exits0. No files were generated. This is progress through native startup, not successful installation or gameplay; the new message does not by itself establish a capacity cause.

Evidence: `scratch/wt-diehard-20261007/scratch/comanche3-preparation/exec-environment/mcb-installer-ready/native-attempt1/validation.json` (SHA-256 `fe0b217eb2a6d6e7022189cad16c5016ade01fa12bd1cf3fc8536e897c83443e`) seals the original screenshot, result, log, identity and cleanup. `mcb-attempt1/receipt.json` and preceding immutable attempt directories retain positive and negative contracts. Runtime source pins SHA-256 `afc9c854c35481273476e9469ad7405b07d6caeff59bb28f2a40015e7bfad79a`. The production repair remains unmerged pending review. Next source investigation is the actual extended-memory query/allocation and error branch; do not inflate memory or bypass the installer based solely on its message.

## Native graphical installation, 2026-10-08

The earlier paging dependency is complete on main (`72e306790`, foundation
`4b0955e79`); see `ops/handoffs/toyvm-paging-complete-20261007.md`. This phase
used isolated base `329bb48d7f37f5071b722f7fe8a7eca3a6a72aea`, with no CPU or
DOS implementation changes. The fresh remotely compiled tailcall module is
`91747769679ce2e661242d0777c1f0fb5aeffe48cbbe2f71ea9443eaf57a45cf`.

Evidence: `scratch/runs/20261008T0433Z-comanche3-install/`. On fresh no-env boat
`bx_2bg9dma5`, Node 24.18.1 / V8 13.6.233.17-node.50, AMD Ryzen 9 9950X,
the unchanged original INSTALL.EXE/INSTALL.BIN reached the graphical destination
prompt. Reviewed ordinary Enter accepted `C:\C3DEMO`; reviewed `y` accepted
the subsequent Folder Exists prompt. The final reviewed
`attempt2/screen-008.png` shows **File Copy, copying MAKEICON.EXE from C:\ to
C:\C3DEMO\, 3% installed**. This establishes native graphical installer
interaction and installation progress, not completion or gameplay.

The corrected execution ended normally at 04:48:39.651 UTC, within the original
04:48:54.095 deadline: 235.9166 execution-wall seconds, 165,404,857 dispatches,
16.51805 guest seconds, `ranOutOfTime=true`, guest not exited. No unimplemented
instruction, CPU fault, unhandled condition, bad selector or protected-transfer
stop was recorded. The installer advanced its source cursor from 414,127 to
2,621,525 and produced `setup.cd` (2 bytes), `install.lev` (1), and
`install.tmp` (41,472), plus the empty `00000001`. All four files are exported
with byte hashes; they do not constitute an installed game. `C3.EXE` and
`SETUP.EXE` are absent from the exported payload.

Two harness failures are retained honestly. Attempt0 stopped before guest
execution because screenshot encoding expected `source/node_modules/pngjs`.
The first actual run reached the destination and Folder Exists screens, then
stopped when a non-atomic input-file update exposed incomplete JSON. The retry
corrected command publication with temporary-file rename and a meaningful
partial-write regression; it retained the original overall deadline, reserving
15 seconds for final artifacts. No timer or guest-state bypass was used.

The first run's console still said Loading Install after its screen had become
graphical. A read-only inspector snapshot confirmed native VESA mode 101h,
640x480x8 and ordinary glyph drawing; actual screenshots, rather than console
text, identified the prompt. Inspector snapshots and paused/resumed receipts
are retained. They do not establish a CPU correctness blocker. No paging/IVT
diagnosis or implementation was repeated.

All original media and 79 transferred source/dependency/media pins were
unchanged. The CPU closure matches the earlier accepted source; the only
source-pin difference against final6 was `test/test-toyvm-paging.js`, which
was not executed here. Both actual runs used the same fresh module hash.
All driver/child PIDs and process groups were independently absent; browser
absent, socket list identical to the fresh baseline, streams closed. Retrieved
artifacts were hash checked before scoped prefix removal at 04:49:32.989,
53.338 seconds after the final terminal receipt. Root owns the temporary boat
lifecycle; lease expiry 05:11:20.138 UTC.

Exact absent local fixture directory:
`/home/user/wt-comanche-gameplay-20261008/test/binaries/win98-games-a-d/Commanche3-demo-SW`.
Its five media files were instead reused as immutable hardlinks from the
self-contained paging run's `original/media/`, verified against the original
receipt. Host lookup misses for archive-contained installer resources are
retained in `attempt2/execution.json`; these are not proven missing distribution
files, since the installer rendered its assets and began copying.

Next: execute the original installer with atomic ordinary input and inspect
every prompt promptly; predeclare a finite installation budget and milestones
for source-cursor and exported-file growth. Reach installation completion, then
launch the actual installed C3 executable through the dedicated DOS route.
Gameplay, player control, sound, save behavior and FPS remain unqualified.
