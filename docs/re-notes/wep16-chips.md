# Chip's Challenge (Win16 WEP4)

## Background music — 2026-10-13

A fresh profile starts with Background Music unchecked. Enabling it through
Options (command 117) previously produced “The MIDI Mapper is not available.
Continue?” and no music. Both `CHIP01.MID` and `CHIP02.MID` were already mounted.

The MMSYSTEM.701 bridge converted the outer `mciSendCommand` parameter pointer
but forwarded its nested selector:offset strings as flat addresses. The resulting
MCI device had neither the intended sequencer type nor the MIDI file. Marshal
MCI_OPEN into stack scratch, translate flagged string fields, retain numeric
TYPE_ID/ELEMENT_ID fields, and copy only the returned WORD device ID back.
Win16 has a reserved WORD after that ID, so the remaining offsets match Win32;
the reserved WORD and caller strings must remain intact. Layout reference:
[Wine's MCI_OPEN_PARMS16](https://github.com/wine-mirror/wine/blob/master/include/wine/mmsystem16.h).

The second failure was the host sequencer's MCI_SEQ_STATUS_PORT query returning
zero. It now reports MIDI_MAPPER (`0xffffffff`) for its default synth output.
The game then issues MCI_PLAY itself, without dismissing a warning or patching
guest memory.

Validation: full build, `test-win16-task-args-mmsystem.js`, `test-midi-mci.js`,
and `test-win16-wep4-gameplay.js chips` pass. The adapter regression uses real
Win16 Pascal frames, checks translated pointers and TYPE_ID, and verifies that
only the two device-ID bytes change in the caller's block. Chrome cooperative
mode loads `chip02.mid`, parses 1,466 notes, and emits nonzero PCM at the master
bus after ordinary Options > Background Music clicks. This verifies playback
startup; Safari and an entire song/end-of-song transition were not tested.

Evidence is in `scratch/runs/20261013-chips-music-before/` (failed command trace)
and `scratch/runs/20261013-chips-music-after/` (successful command trace,
reviewed browser screenshot, browser menu/on-off log and PCM measurements).
The tested WASM SHA-256 is
`d19c10b798cf71449551fa0387ce5e971c3c3c083aa47ca78f800a0fb7364d58`.
There is no Chip's Challenge candidate-corpus ID, so no unrelated dashboard
candidate is attached to this evidence.

## Gameplay regression workflow — 2026-09-19

`test/test-win16-wep4-gameplay.js` formerly clicked screen (200,310), then
held Right under `--real-ticks` with a 700 ms host sleep. That click is not
merely an overlay-dismissal button: it steers Chip down the board and routes
subsequent keyboard input to the `BoardClass` child (HWND 0x10002). The old
test failed its >10,000 changed-pixel assertion on the current runtime.

Changing only the clock to `--tick-ms-per-batch=5` misleadingly passed:
26,700 pixels changed in the old ROI with **or without** Right, and both final
images were identical. The screenshot showed the board scrolling vertically
after the mouse action. This is not proof of working keyboard movement.

The corrected workflow dismisses the lesson overlay with Enter at batches
50/51, captures at 150, holds Right from 170 to 290, and captures at 280.
Use `--batch-size=20000 --tick-ms-per-batch=5 --repaint-every=5`, stop at 310.
With no mouse click, input routes to the main window. Visual inspection shows
Chip facing/moving right and the board scrolling horizontally.

The test runs an otherwise identical no-Right control. It requires identical
starting boards, zero board change in the control, and >10,000 changed board
pixels under Right. The board ROI (56,76,288,288) excludes all counter digits.
Measured: control **0**, movement **33,642** changed pixels. No guest/runtime
code is changed. The BoardClass focus behavior after mouse input is not
thereby proven native-correct and remains a separate investigation.

Verification: the complete WEP4 suite passes **7/7**. Removing the Right
keydown from the test in memory makes the board-movement assertion fail,
confirming the test no longer passes from startup/timer changes alone.
Logs: `/private/tmp/wa-chips-corrected-suite.log` and
`/private/tmp/wa-chips-no-right-negative.log`.

Local evidence: `/private/tmp/chips-probe.log`, `chips-fixed.log`,
`chips-control.log`, `chips-key.log`, `chips-key-control.log` and their PNGs.
Run the maintained regression with:

```sh
node test/test-win16-wep4-gameplay.js chips
```
