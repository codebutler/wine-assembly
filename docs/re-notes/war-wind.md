# War Wind (USA) and War Wind II — Human Onslaught (Europe)

Both are DreamForge / SSI RTS games shipped as CD images (`.cue`/`.bin`) with
InstallShield 3 setups. Verified 2026-09-28: both install from the mounted CD
and reach real gameplay with the CD still mounted.

## Discs

| Game | Setup | Installed exe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| War Wind | IS3 **Win16** `SETUP.EXE` | `WARWIND\WW.EXE` | music streams from `D:\warwind\data\res.003` at runtime, so the CD must stay mounted |
| War Wind II | IS3 `SETUP.EXE` → `_ins0432._mp` engine | `C:\WarWind II\warwind2.exe` + `smackw32.dll` | data in `data\res.000/001/008`, `network\*.lvl` |

## Bugs fixed to get here

- **War Wind setup: `OpenFile(OF_CREATE)` alone was read-only.** The Win16
  SETUP creates its engine stage file with style `0x1000` (access bits = OF_READ)
  and then `_lwrite`s into it. DOS create (INT 21h AH=3Ch) always opens
  read/write; `$handle_OpenFile` now does the same whenever OF_CREATE is set.
  Covered by `test/test-openfile-create.js`.
- **War Wind II setup spun forever in SdAskOptions.** The IS3 engine's startup
  (`_ins0432._mp` `0x408cc9` → `0x408d29` → `0x40931f`) registers GDI32,
  KERNEL32, USER32 into a DLL list at `[0x4964ac]` by GetModuleHandleA for
  system DLLs, **stopping at the first NULL**. `GetModuleHandleA("GDI32")`
  returned 0, so USER32 was never registered, and every script call into USER32
  (resolved by `0x408f7f`, lstrcmpiA over that list) was silently dropped — the
  dialog never appeared. `gdi32` is now in `$STATIC_SYS_DLL_NAMES` (before the
  DirectX tail; `$STATIC_SYS_DLL_FIRST_DX` is 4, and the DPLAYX/DSOUND ordinal
  rules in `08b-dll-loader.wat` derive their positions from it). Covered by
  `test/test-wide-api.js`.

## Headless commands

The CLI resolves import DLLs beside the host exe, so for War Wind II copy
`smackw32.dll` out of the install overlay next to a host copy of
`warwind2.exe` (otherwise: `UNIMPLEMENTED API: <ord>`).

**War Wind II also runs straight off the disc, no install needed**:
`WW2\WARWIND2.EXE` and `WW2\SMACKW32.DLL` are stored uncompressed on the
CD. Extract both beside each other and point the guest path at `D:`:

```sh
node tools/cue-bin-to-iso.js "<disc>.cue" ww2.iso
node tools/iso-dir.js ww2.iso --extract='WW2\WARWIND2.EXE' --out=host/warwind2.exe
node tools/iso-dir.js ww2.iso --extract='WW2\SMACKW32.DLL' --out=host/smackw32.dll
node test/run.js --exe=host/warwind2.exe --exe-guest-path='d:\ww2\warwind2.exe' \
  --media-mount="<disc>.cue" --media-exe=SETUP.EXE --cwd='D:\WW2' \
  --screen=800x600 --no-build --quiet-api --count=0xa205c0
```

### Intro movie (Smacker, through the game's own `smackw32.dll`)

`WW2OPEN.SMK` is 2169 frames, 640x160 at 15 fps (144.6 s), shown
letterboxed in a 640x480 DDraw surface. It plays in full with no WAT
Smacker code: smackw32.dll runs as ordinary guest x86. The DLL loads at
`0xa1c000` (origBase `0x400000`), so `_SmackDoFrame@4` (`+0x4045c0`) is
`0xa205c0`, `_SmackWait@4` `0xa1f170`, `_SmackOpen@12` `0xa20ef0`.
`--trace-at` on DoFrame prints nothing (it is not called on the main
thread's batch boundary); `--count` works.

Decode throughput, measured 2026-09-28 by running to fixed `--max-batches`
(deterministic) and reading the DoFrame count, on the M1 at load 5-8:

| batch | frames | wall |
|---|---|---|
| 10,000 | 334 | 8.2 s |
| 20,000 | 617 | 16.1 s |
| 40,000 | 1,199 | 26.4 s |
| 80,000 | 2,169 | 72.0 s |

That is ~36-56 decoded fps against the 15 fps the movie needs, 2.5-3.5x
real time headless. The headless clock runs ahead, so the decoder never
waits and this is its ceiling; browser paint is not included.
On the 10,000-batch runs, ~30 batches go by per frame.

```sh
# install (drive with tools/ctl.js on the control port)
node test/run.js --media-mount="<disc>.cue" --media-exe=SETUP.EXE \
  --overlay-dir=/tmp/ww2-overlay --screen=800x600 --quiet-api \
  --control=8133 --frozen --max-seconds=3000

# run the installed game with the CD mounted
node test/run.js --exe=<host>/warwind2.exe --exe-guest-path='c:\warwind ii\warwind2.exe' \
  --media-mount="<disc>.cue" --media-exe=SETUP.EXE --cwd='C:\WarWind II' \
  --overlay-dir=/tmp/ww2-overlay --screen=800x600 --no-build --quiet-api \
  --control=8133 --frozen
```

## Driving it (screen/PNG coordinates at `--screen=800x600`)

Both games poll `GetKeyState` for the button, so a bare ctl `click` is lost:
send `mousemove`, step ~60, `mousedown`, step ~60, `mouseup`.

- **WW2 install:** Welcome Next (494,454) → options (Suggested) Next →
  destination `C:\WarWind II` Next → "create directory?" Yes (334,363) → copy →
  DirectX prompt No (434,336) → README prompt → setup exits 0.
- **WW2 game:** main menu star button (677,108) → mission screen → Start Game
  (450,32) → loading → tip dialog (right button 436,314) → "Start Game?" Yes
  (354,456) → gameplay.
- **WW1 game:** race circle (150,120) → Begin New Campaign (472,543) → campaign
  map → the black box at (665,540) is "Begin the scenario" (its art is missing —
  open question) → briefing → army screen → checkmark (665,535) → zoom-in
  transition (static for a few thousand batches while the level initialises in
  `0x4252xx`) → tip dialog. **The round-arrow button (437,317) closes the tip**;
  the checkmark on the left is "Next tip" → gameplay.

## Open questions

- ~~`$handle_ICOpen` returns 0, so WW1's Cinepak AVIs are skipped.~~ Fixed:
  `09a7g-video-icm.wat` opens Cinepak and `09a7f-video-avi.wat` reads the
  files, so `LOGOS.AVI` and `WWOPEN.AVI` play in-game (dd4437aa). All 63 disc
  AVIs are Cinepak 320x240 15 fps + 22 kHz PCM, and they are listed in
  `tools/avi-player/` from `test/binaries/cd-movies/War Wind/`.
- WW1's "Begin the scenario" button draws as a black box.

## Multiplayer Wizard (WW1) -- 2026-09-28

Clicking the centre icon of the race screen (320,240 at `--screen=800x600`)
runs `FlipToGDISurface` and then `PropertySheetA`: the DreamForge
"Multiplayer Wizard", a one-page-at-a-time wizard over the exclusive 640x480
DirectDraw display. Its Welcome page has two labels, an `SS_OWNERDRAW` static
(id 101) that the dialog proc fills with a 120x225 `BitBlt` of the character
artwork on `WM_DRAWITEM`, and the Back/Next/Cancel buttons.

Two bugs made it look like "no text and wrong fullscreen":

- `$create_property_sheet` always set `$main_hwnd` to the sheet frame, since
  it was written for Jazz2's demo installer, where the wizard is the whole UI.
  `get_dx_present_hwnd` returns `$main_hwnd`, so the game's primary was
  uploaded as a dxLayer **onto the wizard**, clipped to its client area
  (`[dx] Upload slot=2 640x480 target=dxLayer hwnd=0x10002 ...
  clip=43,63 434x283`). Every label and button was covered by the game frame,
  and the canvas composite zoomed onto the wizard rect with black around it.
  The sheet now becomes main only when there is no visible main window, and
  the primary stays on hwnd 0x10001 (`test/test-property-sheet-main-hwnd.js`).
- An `SS_OWNERDRAW` static painted itself as an empty label and never sent
  `WM_DRAWITEM`, so the artwork panel was blank. It now sends
  `WM_DRAWITEM`/`ODT_STATIC` to its parent
  (`test/test-static-ownerdraw-drawitem.js`).

WW1 runs straight off the disc, with no install needed for this route:

```sh
node test/run.js --exe=<host>/ww.exe --exe-guest-path='d:\warwind\ww.exe' \
  --media-mount="<War Wind (USA).cue>" --media-exe=SETUP.EXE --cwd='D:\WARWIND' \
  --screen=800x600 --no-build --quiet-api --no-close --png-canvas --png=ww1.png \
  --input=1500:mousedown:320:240,1560:mouseup:320:240,3000:mousedown:320:240,3060:mouseup:320:240 \
  --max-batches=4500 --max-seconds=100
```

The first click skips the intro; the second opens the wizard. The caption
really is "test wizard"; that is the game's own string. WW2's tutorial text
rendered correctly headless, and its failure was not reproduced.
