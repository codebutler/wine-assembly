# Morrowind (GOTY retail ISO) — local-only candidate

Retail, so **localhost only**: `morrowind` is in `LOCAL_CANDIDATE_APPS` (the
dropdown `index.html` shows only on localhost), never `DESKTOP_APPS`. Nothing
made from the disc is committed, and `tools/deploy-berrry.js` refuses
`test/binaries/candidates/morrowind/` and `downloads/` by name, `--files=`
included (`test/test-deploy-morrowind-local-only.js`). You bring your own disc:

```bash
node tools/prepare-morrowind.js --iso=path/to/your/Morrowind.iso   # needs unshield + 7z
node test/run.js --app=morrowind --memory-mb=1024 --headless-gl --quiet-api \
  --tick-ms-per-batch=2 --stuck-after=100000 --no-close --max-seconds=170
```

The prep tool unpacks `data1.cab` (unshield) and DirectShow out of
`DX81eng.exe` (7z) into `installed/`, copies `Video\*` + the autorun files
into `cd/` with a one-track cue over the image (D: is a CD-ROM labelled
MORROWIND), and writes `.wine-assembly-browser.json`. That manifest also
carries the 432 registry keys `regsvr32 /s` writes for devenum, quartz and
l3codecx, in that order: registering quartz first misses the filter-mapper
`Instance` keys. Both hosts import those keys at every launch. Without them the
title music fails with "Music Error: Can not create filter graph."
The browser path is unverified. It fetches the whole ~900 MB tree eagerly.

## Reproduce (manual, pre-entry)

```bash
I=test/binaries/candidates/morrowind/installed
node test/run.js --exe="$I/Morrowind.exe" --dll-seed=binkw32.dll --vfs-include='**' \
  --iso=downloads/Morrowind.iso --reg-import=test/binaries/candidates/morrowind/registry.json \
  --memory-mb=1024 --headless-gl --quiet-api --stuck-after=100000 --no-close \
  --max-batches=9000000 --max-seconds=570 --input=...
```

- `--iso` because the game checks for its CD and reads `d:\video\*.bik` from it.
- `--memory-mb=1024`: at 512 MB the sparse arena runs out while DirectShow
  builds the title-music graph (`[heap] OOM ... sparse arena`), and the game
  shows `Music Error: Can not play file ... morrowind title.mp3` then exits.
- `--headless-gl`: Morrowind renders through D3D8 on the GL backend.
- `--wasm-enforce-bounds-checks` (a node flag) only when chasing a SIGBUS: the
  headless-gl native module installs a segfault handler that turns a wasm
  out-of-bounds access into SIGBUS with no stack. The flag makes it a JS trap
  with a wasm stack. It costs roughly 3x.

## Reaching gameplay (2026-09-19)

Reached: the prison-ship hold with Jiub, textured, lit and animating. About
2k batches after `chargenname1.mp3` the game shows its "Name" text-entry
prompt (label, caret, OK) over the world, then waits for input. That is the
end of what the driver automates. Before the mip-chain fix the prompt drew as
an empty frame on a fog clear: the UI font textures hit the same rejected
draws. What gets there, in one run of about
3.5 minutes of wall clock:

- The driver: `node test/binaries/candidates/morrowind/drive-morrowind.js OUTDIR 2 1500`.
  It is gitignored like everything else here. Its screenshots are
  `OUTDIR/world-N.png`.
- `--tick-ms-per-batch=2` for the **whole** run, plus `--control-stdin`. The
  driver watches which files the game reads and reacts:

  | file the game reads | driver's mode | what the driver does |
  |---|---|---|
  | a `.bik` in boot | video | ESC pulse every 3 s |
  | `mw_logo.bik` | menu | alternate ESC and a DI click, which lands on New |
  | `splash\*.tga` after the menu | world load | nothing, just wait |
  | `mw_intro.bik` | intro | ESC pulse every 3 s |
  | `music\explore\*` | world | take the screenshots |

  **Do not treat `.bsa` reads after the menu as a world load.** The menu
  itself reads `morrowind.bsa`, and treating that as "loading" made the
  driver stop clicking.
- Timeline at tick 2 (~5000 batches/s):

  | batch | event |
  |---|---|
  | 13.6k | Bethesda logo, skipped at once |
  | 515k | `mw_logo` / menu |
  | 539k | New |
  | 568k | `mw_intro`, skipped |
  | 570k | in world |

- The WebGL D3D9 backend used to reject most world draws, so the world
  showed as a bare fog clear with a crosshair. Two fixes (both in
  `test/test-d3d9-webgl-partial-mips.js`):
  - **Partial mip chains.** Morrowind's DDS textures stop above 1x1, and
    `lib/d3d9-backend.js` threw `incomplete mip chain`. It now clamps with
    `TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL` on WebGL2, and box-filters the missing levels on
    WebGL1 (headless GL).
  - **Lit draws with no NORMAL.** `lib/d3d9-fixed.js` threw `missing vertex
    semantic 3:0`. The normal now reads as zero, as it does on D3D9.

## What the startup load spends its time on

The load is compute-bound: 79% of batches spend their whole block budget and
only the main thread runs. From the block histogram at batches 100k-200k:

- ~30% msvcrt `_stricmp` (runtime `0xbb37cb`), a byte-at-a-time loop, called from
- ~20% `Morrowind.exe` `0x4b47e0`, a linear list walk that looks up objects by
  name (`vtbl+0x20` GetID, then `_stricmp`, then next). Every lookup walks the
  list, so the load is O(n^2) in the game's own code.
- ~5% `0x6e2e60`, texture conversion one pixel at a time.

`_stricmp` is now bound to the native handler even though the real msvcrt.dll
is loaded (`$native_override_export_api_id` in `08b-dll-loader.wat`, like
`_ftol`). The measurement is fixed work, boot to menu at tick 2, with GL up.
The driver quits when it reaches the menu, and the CPU is `user` from
`/usr/bin/time`:

| arm | batches to menu | user CPU | load avg |
|---|---|---|---|
| without the override | 523k | 97.9 s | 6 |
| with the override | 441k | 74.7 s | 5 |

So the override is about 24% less CPU and 16% fewer batches. It makes ~9.8M
native `_stricmp` calls before the menu (16.6M API calls in total against
6.8M). Splash order is random, so a few thousand batches of it is noise.

Timing on this box is only worth quoting at a low load average. At load 26-61
the same two arms swapped places in wall-clock time from one run to the next.

Two traps:

- **A run whose log has `[gl] context creation FAILED ... No suitable
  display` does not count.** GLFW found no monitor, nothing renders, and it
  reaches the menu at 385k because it skips all drawing.
- **Suppressing the per-call API log is not a lever.** Each API call crosses
  into JS twice (`log`, `log_api_exit`). Gating both behind a wasm flag
  measured 84.3 s against 80.7 s ungated with the same `_stricmp` build on a
  quiet box, which is noise, so it was not kept.

The driver's `MW_STOP_AT=menu MW_NO_TRACE=1` env switches do the fixed-work
run. `MW_NO_TRACE` takes the `[FS] ReadFile` lines the driver keys on from
`--trace-fs` instead of `--trace-api`. Without either, the driver sees no
reads and sits in Bink forever.

Dropping msvcrt.dll entirely is not an option. Morrowind imports C++ exception
handling from it (`__CxxFrameHandler`, the `exception` class members), and
quartz.dll and devenum.dll import it too.

### The emulator heap (2026-09-19)

With `_stricmp` gone, the next cost in any load (the startup load, and the
cell load right after entering the world) was the emulator's own heap:
`$heap_arena_find` 21% and `$heap_alloc` 20% of CPU over batches 150k-250k.
`$heap_alloc` walks one first-fit free list and validates every link through
`$heap_arena_find`, which scanned the whole arena table each time. The lookup
now tries the arena that answered last before scanning. Same fixed work (boot
to batch 250k, tick 2, GL up), user CPU:

| arm | run 1 | run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| HEAD | 51.3 s | 51.2 s |
| arena hint | 30.0 s | |

About 41% less. Left afterwards: `$heap_alloc` 5.4%, `$heap_arena_find` 1.2%,
so size-class free lists would not buy much more.

### The GPU sync per draw

Past the cell load, the world window (batches 560k-600k) is almost all native
GL: 37-38% of CPU is one headless-gl native frame. `lib/d3d9-host.js` called
`gl.finish()` after **every** command, so each draw stalled the pipeline. It
now drains only where something observes the result (fence, readback,
release, reset, a failed command) and flushes at Present. Same wasm, only
`d3d9-host.js` differing, CPU profile of the fixed world window:

| arm | sampled CPU, batches 560k-600k | in the GL sync frame |
|---|---|---|
| finish every command | 68.6 s | 26.6 s (38.8%) |
| finish at observation points | 44.0 s | none |

About 36% less in the world. What was left there was mostly JS: the
command stream's payload copy (`d3d-command-stream.js` `copy`, 18%) and
`run.js`'s `h.log` (19%, plus 8.6% in its callback). `h.log` is called by
`$win32_dispatch` for every API call, and for a COM method it resolved the
name with a linear `apiTable.find` over ~3700 entries. Nearly every call in
the D3D8 world is COM. It is now an index lookup. This is CLI only; the
browser has no such hook.

Every `MW_NO_TRACE` run, on every build, puts up a `Warning` box a few
thousand batches into the world: `Model Load Error:
Meshes\a\A_Imperial_UA_Pauldron.nif cannot load file`. The box draws with no
message text. Neither is investigated yet.

The profile tooling: the driver's `MW_ROOT` runs a worktree's `run.js`, and
`MW_MAX_BATCHES` ends the run at a fixed batch (run.js takes the *first*
`--max-batches`, so passing one through `MW_EXTRA` does nothing). Wake the
display (`caffeinate -u -t 3`) before each run, or GLFW finds no monitor.
`tools/cpuprof-top.js --names` resolves names from `build/combined.wat` beside
it, so a profile of a pinned `WINE_ASSEMBLY_WASM` needs that build's
`combined.wat`, or every name is wrong.

## Boot sequence (default 200 ms/batch, 1000-block batches)

| batch | what |
|---|---|
| ~7k | `bethesda logo.bik` (Bink, has audio) |
| 150k-250k | loading bar over `splash_*.tga` (splash picture itself draws light blue — not investigated) |
| ~560k | `mw_logo.bik`, then title music via DirectShow |
| ~600k | main menu: New / Load / Options / Credits / Exit |
| click | `di-mousedown:1`/`di-mouseup:1` with no move lands on **New** (the DI cursor starts at screen centre, 320,240) |
| +70k | world load (splash TGAs, `morrowind.bsa`/`.esm` reads), then `mw_intro.bik` |

## The Bink clock problem (the main blocker)

Bink paces video against wall time (`timeGetTime`/`QueryPerformanceCounter`
and the DirectSound play cursor). At the default 200 ms/batch, decoding one
frame costs more guest time than the frame lasts, so Bink is permanently
behind: it decodes and skips forever and never presents, with **zero** API
calls from the main thread (main loops inside binkw32 `+0xd100..0xd1db`, the
bitstream decoder). The picture is byte-identical for 300k+ batches. This hit
the Bethesda logo in some runs and `mw_intro.bik` in every run.

ESC only skips a video when it lands while the decoder is between frames, so
ESC schedules are luck, not a fix. What works is a slower guest clock:
`--tick-ms-per-batch=2` plays the logos visibly. `--input=B:tick-ms:N` switches
the cadence mid-run so the boot can stay on the fast clock (added for this app).

Large batches (`--batch-size=10000 --tick-ms-per-batch=20`) give the same
ops-per-guest-ms with fewer batches, but PNG captures of the D3D8 frame came
back as the empty GDI window intermittently at that batch size — use the
default batch size when a picture matters.

## Music restarts every ~1000 batches — not a bug

After the intro, exploration music (`music\explore\mx_explore_N.mp3`) opens a
new DirectShow graph about every 1000 batches. A 3-minute track at
200 ms/batch is ~900 batches, so the tracks really are ending. It does mean
many graph builds per run, which is part of why 512 MB runs out.

## Emulator fixes this app needed (2026-09-18)

- `CoCreateFreeThreadedMarshaler` + FTM inner/IMarshal objects (quartz).
- `ReplyMessage` (one pending reply per cross-thread send depth).
- COM in-proc DLL loads requested from a **cooperative worker thread** (yield 3)
  were never serviced — T3 parked forever. `run.js`/`host.js` now service them
  and sync main's DLL/thunk globals into the worker first (`adoptMainGlobals`).
- `$load_dll` rebases an image that would overflow the low guest spans into a
  sparse reservation. Before, `l3codecx.ax` was placed at `0x45e6000` and its
  image overwrote emulator tables (PAGE_INDEX_ARENA), which surfaced as
  `0xCAC4BAD0` dispatch garbage. quartz/devenum/l3codecx now load near
  `0x7e8x_xxxx`.
- Import-name logging in `$win32_dispatch` used `GUEST_BASE + rva` instead of
  `g2w(image_base + rva)` — out of bounds for a rebased DLL.
- `$static_sys_dll_name_at` stops at the list terminator; a rebased DLL's
  handle is above the pseudo-handle base and used to walk off the list
  (`GetModuleFileNameA`).

## Threads

binkw32 starts two worker threads that sit in `WaitForSingleObject` at
binkw32 `+0xd3c3` (runtime `0x8e13c3` when binkw32 loads at `0x8d4000`,
origBase `0x30000000`). quartz threads appear and exit per graph; one reports
`EIP=0 (likely call/jmp to NULL)` when its thread proc returns — harmless.

## What is hot now, and whether "C++ opts" is the lever (2026-09-19)

One window, `--handler-hist-thread=0 --handler-hist-start=150000
--handler-hist-stop=250000` over the boot/load phase (tick 2, GL up,
`--quiet-api`), with `--hist-json` + `--hot-block-dump`. Counts are
load-immune, so the load-16 box is fine for this. 481.9M ops, 77.2M block
entries, **6.24 ops/block**, 13455 distinct blocks. By module: exe 74.9%,
msvcrt 14.0%, binkw32 0.3%.

The single hottest block is **15.33% of every block entry in the window** —
four times the next one — and it is a C++ container walk:

```
00479abb   test edx,edx / jz            ; __thiscall, ecx = this, eax = N
00479abf   mov edx,[ecx+0x8]            ; cursor = this->head
00479ac2   mov [ecx+0x10],edx
...
00479acd   dec eax                      ; <-- the hot block, self-looping
00479ace   mov edx,[ecx+0x10]           ; cursor
00479ad1   mov edx,[edx+0x4]            ; cursor = cursor->next
00479ad4   mov [ecx+0x10],edx           ; write it back to the object
00479ad7   jnz 0x479acd
```

Seek-to-index over a singly linked list, with the cursor spilled to
`this+0x10` on every step. It has no static xrefs (`tools/xrefs.js`), so it
is reached through a pointer — it is the walk behind the `0x4b47e0` O(n^2)
name lookup already recorded above. Next after it: `0x6e2e8d` and
`0x6f1bb4` at 4.07% each, the per-pixel texture conversion
(byte loads, `shr`/`shl` by CL, `movzx`), then a flat tail of ~1.3% blocks.

Handler ranking for the window: `$th_load32_rop` 12.0%, `$th_load8_ro`
10.4%, `$th_inc_r` 5.3%, `$th_store32_rop` 5.3%, `$th_push_r` 5.2%.

**So: yes to one C++ idiom, no to the obvious ones.** Folding vtable
dispatch, `thiscall` prologues or `push`/`pop` runs is *control flow*, and
this project has already measured that class at ~0 twice (`case_chain`,
dispatch replication's arm H). `0x479acd` is the opposite: a **memory**
idiom, which is the class that has paid here (`rect_run` +12%, `RLE_RUN`
+7%).

It is also a true self-loop block, so `$loop_match_block` in
`src/07b-loop-match.wat` already sees it and declines it.
`tools/match-loops.js --why` on this exe: 5224 self-loops, 2.3% matched, and
**29 `non-streamed-load`** declines — the existing COPY/FILL/LUT/SCAN
predicates all require an *affine* address stream, and a pointer chase has
none. The extension is a fifth predicate: a load whose address is fed by the
value the previous iteration loaded, with one counter and one store back to
a fixed slot.

Arithmetic before building anything: 11.8M block entries and ~59M ops of the
window collapse to ~11.8M handler iterations inside one block entry. At the
`bench-loops.js` prices (~8 ns a dispatch, ~9 ns a block transfer) that is
the largest single interpreter item Morrowind has. But the chase is
serial dependent loads, so the real ceiling is memory latency, not dispatch,
and the fold's win will be smaller than the op count suggests.

**Not yet evidence: this is ONE window, and it is a loading window.** The
`hot-loop-census.js` rule applies — a region at 15% in one window and absent
in the next is a scene, not a fold target. Take the in-world window
(560k-600k) and a menu window before writing any WAT, and remember the world
window is already 37-38% native GL, so the same fold is worth much less
there.

### CORRECTION: that block is a scene, not a fold target (2026-09-19, later)

The 15.33% above is **one loading window**, and it does not survive more of
them. Two independent harnesses now say so.

Six consecutive CLI windows, one run, 750k batches to the post-"New" intro
(`--handler-hist-thread=0,0,0,0,0,0 --handler-hist-start=150000
--handler-hist-stop=750000 --hist-json=`, with `620000:di-mousedown:1` to
click New):

| window | batches | what it is | `exe+0x479a80..479ad9` |
|---|---|---|---|
| w1 | 150k-250k | splash + bink | 8.0% |
| w2 | 250k-350k | loading | 12.9% |
| w3 | 350k-450k | loading | 0.3% |
| w4 | 450k-550k | menu | 6.6% |
| w5 | 550k-650k | menu | 3.2% |
| w6 | 650k-750k | `mw_intro.bik` | **0.0%** |

Mean 5.2%, spread 12.9pp. And twelve windows taken in a real Chrome (below)
never had `0x479acd` in the top **forty** blocks at all.

`tools/hot-loop-census.js` returns the same verdict on both sets:

> NO region holds >=5% of block entries in every window. Nothing here is a
> safe fold target on this evidence.

The list walk is real and recurring, but it is a *load-time* name lookup, so
it is big exactly when the game is reading assets and absent when it is
playing a video. This is the SimGolf/H455 trap the census tool was built for,
and it was one window away from being repeated here. **A Morrowind-specific
fold is not the next work item.** The cross-app levers in
[hot-idiom-census-2026-09-19.md](../hot-idiom-census-2026-09-19.md) —
`cmp`/`test` + Jcc fusion, then the zero-then-load8 / load8+inc pair — are,
because they pay in every window of every app rather than in one scene of
this one.

Still not measured: gameplay proper. w6 is the intro movie; the world window
is past it.

## Driving it in a real browser (frozen mode)

`?app=morrowind&frozen&debug` plus `window.WineFrozen.step(n)` runs the
browser build under an agent's control, which is the only way to reach the
Worker-hosted code path (`--threads` in the CLI keeps the guest's MAIN thread
in-process; the browser puts it in worker slot 0). Three things that cost a
session each:

- **The dev-server needs `--isolate`.** Without the COOP/COEP headers the page
  reports `[threads] not cross-origin isolated — running single-threaded` and
  quietly runs the mode you were not testing.
- **Wait on `WineFrozen.status().hosts`, not on console text.** The
  worker-hosted main thread never prints the cooperative path's "DLLs ready" /
  "Starting run", and a frozen host prints nothing until it is stepped.
  `runningApps` is module-scoped in `browser-shell.js`, not a global.
- The ~5930-file mount takes a minute or two before any of this; give it its
  own budget or it eats the stepping one.

Morrowind at 16ms/step was still on `Initializing Data…` after 26,000 steps
(390s of guest time), so browser windows reach the loading phase only.

## The Worker-mode COM reload loop (2026-09-19)

Threads mode in the browser dies a few seconds in:

```
[COM] Loading DLL: quartz.dll (worker)      x~30, each ~0x130000 lower
[COM] DLL load error: DLL table capacity 32 exhausted
[threads] guest trapped in worker: unreachable @ EIP=0xf523d7
```

`com_create_instance` (`lib/storage.js`) resolves the server through a fixed
`ctx.exports`:

```js
const dllCount  = exports.get_dll_count();
const dllTable  = exports.get_dll_table();
const imageBase = exports.get_image_base();
```

In browser worker mode that is host.js's **idle** instance — the one that
never loaded the PE. `dll_count` is a per-instance global, so the row the
worker just appended is invisible to it, and its `image_base` is 0, so the
export-name reads would be wrong even if the count were right. Every retry
returns `CO_E_DLLNOTFOUND`, the guest yields 3 again, and
`_handleComDllLoadThreaded` (host.js) maps another copy — until the shared
32-row table is exhausted and the thread runs into garbage.

`a4bd125c` fixed the CLI shape of this (`_publishLinkLoaderState` raises main's
count after a worker load) but the browser reaches the loader through
`host.js` → `guest-thread-host.js comLoadDll`, which never publishes. The
right fix is probably to resolve against the **calling** link rather than a
fixed instance, since raising the count alone still leaves `image_base` 0.

It reproduces only at full speed: 1300 frozen steps never trapped, and the
first unfrozen seconds did. It is a race, so a frozen bisect will not find it.

### FIXED, cf4d4000 (2026-09-19)

The guess above about `image_base` was wrong, and the real cause is narrower.
`image_base` **is** seeded on the idle instance — `loadPe` in worker mode
already follows up with `init_thread(7, meta.get_image_base, ...)`. What is
not carried is `$dll_count`. It is a per-instance global, `init_thread` does
not take it, and nothing published it, so:

- after the worker loads the PE, main's count is 0 while the worker's is N,
  and the **first** `CoCreateInstance` searches zero rows whatever is mapped;
- after the worker loads a COM server, main's count still does not move, so
  the retry stops short of the row just written and asks for the same DLL
  again. Forever.

`a4bd125c` fixed the CLI shape of this in `ThreadManager._publishLinkLoaderState`,
called from its own yield loop. `host.js` services the guest-main worker's COM
and LoadLibrary yields **directly** and never enters that loop, which is why
the browser kept the bug. It now publishes after both, and seeds the count
once after `loadPe`.

Verified in Chrome (`?frozen` + Threads, `tools/dev-server.js --isolate`):
each of quartz.dll, devenum.dll and l3codecx.ax now loads **exactly once**
(quartz was ~30x), no `DLL table capacity 32 exhausted`, no trap, and the
guest gets as far as creating its `ActiveMovie Window`.

## Phase-separated profiles (2026-09-19)

One window is not evidence about where an app spends its time, and on this
title it is actively misleading: the 15.33% block recorded further up came
from a window that turned out to be a **video**. So each phase below is
profiled on its own and labelled by its own PNG rather than by a batch number
copied from another run.

Recipe (CLI, tick 2, `--headless-gl`, `--quiet-api`, GL confirmed up —
a `[gl] context creation FAILED` run does not count):

```bash
ESC=$(for b in $(seq 6000 1500 528000); do printf "%d:keydown:27,%d:keyup:27," $b $((b+40)); done)
node test/run.js --exe="$I/Morrowind.exe" --dll-seed=binkw32.dll --vfs-include='**' \
  --iso=downloads/Morrowind.iso --reg-import=.../registry.json \
  --memory-mb=1024 --headless-gl --quiet-api --stuck-after=100000 --no-close \
  --tick-ms-per-batch=2 --max-batches=9000000 --max-seconds=780 \
  --handler-hist --handler-hist-thread=0,0,0,0,0,0 \
  --handler-hist-start=380000 --handler-hist-stop=530000 --hist-json=OUT/w \
  --input="$ESC,385000:png:OUT/p385000.png,..."
```

**The ESC pulse is load-bearing.** Without it the run never leaves phase A.
This replaces the gitignored `drive-morrowind.js`, which is missing from the
tree; it does not watch which files the game reads, it just pulses.

Timeline at tick 2 *with* the pulses: splash from before 380k to ~515k, menu
by 527k (cursor on New).

### Phase A — Bink intro video

Unskipped, this phase does not end. At batch **249k the Bethesda logo is
still on screen** — the entire 250k-batch budget went into one logo.

| window | ops | block entries | ops/block | distinct blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50k-100k | 481.8M | 53.9M | 8.93 | 1514 |
| 100k-150k | 3085.9M | 200.0M | 15.43 | 246 |
| 150k-200k | 3614.56M | 200.0M | 18.07 | 214 |
| 200k-250k | 3614.55M | 200.0M | 18.07 | 214 |

The last two windows are the same work twice: same 214 blocks, op counts
0.0002% apart, shares equal to 0.1pp. Every hot region is `binkw32`, and
`binkw32+0x3000cb50..3000d306` alone is 81.4 / 76.5 / 76.5% of block entries.
This is the one region in this app measured stable across consecutive
windows — the opposite of `exe+0x479acd`, which is retracted above.

Handlers, 200k-250k window:

| handler | share of dispatches |
|---|---|
| `$th_fpu_mem_ro` (H190) | 37.61% |
| `$th_fpu_reg` (H189) | 22.43% |
| `$th_fpu_mem` (H188) | 6.51% |
| `$th_compute_ea_sib` (H149) | 6.30% |

**66.6% x87.** Adjacent pairs: H190->H190 23.63%, H189->H189 11.34%,
H190->H189 9.72%, H189->H190 9.29% — **54% of all dispatch transitions are
x87 to x87**. The SIB census is the same story: H188 in `[reg+reg*4+disp]`
forms is over 70% of recorded SIB effective addresses.

**Do not read that as "fuse H189/H190".** An x87 fusion was already built and
measured on Monkey Island and gave nothing, because the cost is inside the
helper calls, not in the dispatch between them; what paid there was moving
the x87 registers into the per-thread FPU_FILE (-16%). The finding here is
that the phase is x87-bound, which says to make those three handlers cheaper,
not to glue them together.

### Phase B — asset load, "Initializing Data..." (~380k-515k)

Six 25k windows, all showing the splash with its progress bar. ops/block is
**2.45-9.32** against phase A's 18.07 — this phase is block-transfer-bound,
the opposite shape, and a fold that helps one cannot help the other.

| region | w1 | w2 | w3 | w4 | w5 | w6 | mean | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exe+0x4b47e0..4b48a5` | 1.0 | 0.0 | 22.4 | 51.9 | 30.3 | 0.0 | 17.6% | 51.9pp |
| `exe+0x4db590..4db5d0` | 0.1 | 0.0 | 16.5 | 30.6 | 16.7 | 0.0 | 10.6% | 30.6pp |
| `exe+0x4d10eb..4d1337` | 24.1 | 22.7 | 7.1 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 9.0% | 24.1pp |
| `exe+0x4a45f0..4a480c` | 18.5 | 17.2 | 5.4 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 6.8% | 18.5pp |

`0x4b47e0` is the object-name list walk already identified above as O(n^2) in
the game's own code. It peaks at **51.9%** of block entries and is *absent*
from two of the six windows, so even within one phase it is a sub-scene.
`hot-loop-census.js` verdict for phase B: no region holds >=5% in every
window.

### Phase C — menu, and what is still unmeasured

The menu is up at 527k. It has no window of its own yet: the last window
(505k-530k) straddles the tail of `mw_logo.bik` and the menu, which is why
`binkw32+0x30011d80` reappears at 25.3% there.

**Gameplay is still unmeasured.** Reaching it needs the click on New that the
missing driver performed.

### So "the load" is two unrelated problems

- **Phase A** is what a user actually sits through, and it is a video codec
  being interpreted at 2/3 x87 dispatches.
- **Phase B** is the game's own quadratic name lookup plus emulator block
  transfer.

Quoting one number for "load" hides both.
