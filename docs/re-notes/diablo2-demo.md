# Diablo II Shareware demo

## Package and installer

The local package is Blizzard's `DiabloIIDemo.exe`:

- size: 138,309,685 bytes
- SHA-256: `89352716523e474514553e2092a1ae9349c5c7ff9e79c7861dd65fe19be88b61`

`test/test-diablo2-demo-installer.js` drives setup without fixed-batch dialog
timing. It waits for `Diablo II Shareware Setup`, clicks the launcher's Install
button, waits for each real InstallShield control, accepts the default path,
and reaches the shortcut/copy phase. A full acceptance run continued through
the 127 MiB copy. The worker finished after about 205 seconds; the outer setup
window remained on `Adding shortcuts to the start menu..`, but the complete
installed payload was present in the VFS. The retained acceptance screenshot
is `/private/tmp/diablo2-installer-complete.png`.

Saving that VFS exposed a host-export collision: setup creates both the file
`C:\support\images\msproxy` and descendants below a directory with that name.
`lib/vfs-export.js` now preserves the file as `msproxy.__vfs_file__` rather
than failing the whole export. `test/test-vfs-export.js` pins that behavior.

The installer-produced payload is staged locally under
`test/binaries/candidates/diablo-2-demo-installer/installed-extracted/`. Its
core pins are:

| File | Size | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `diablo ii.exe` | 2,154,496 | `d0aa0d30b55f8313e04026cca560ef0d178ee76b2ece6c3ccdc1fca4af46b3f1` |
| `d2data.mpq` | 44,301,122 | `82ed65b7f574234a22a36abb4a6d6a1e7f8bebc4746192f39cdb6603ee382d49` |
| `d2music.mpq` | 32,743,265 | `631172d59cc4a8d9b42faade73b194140b6a327811ea556562df9c89f857a694` |
| `storm.dll` | 266,280 | `2b6a27f223aac30d2d383f185705be55f43f37a687aa76ebe307a1035b6eea2d` |

## Registry evidence

The raw captures remain under `/private/tmp` and are not corpus fixtures.
Relative to a clean profile, setup wrote:

- `HKCU\Software\Battle.net\Configuration`, `Server List` = `exodus.battle.net`
- `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Battle.net\Configuration`, `Server List` = `exodus.battle.net`

A clean installed-game launch reaches the menu without pre-seeding either
key. The game itself creates
`HKCU\Software\Blizzard Entertainment\Diablo II Shareware` with:

- `CmdLine` = `ii.exe -skiptobnet`
- `InstallPath` = `C:\`
- `UseCmdLine` = DWORD `0`

It also probes `CompressedData` and preference values, but none is required to
launch this package.

## Compatibility fixes

The installed executable and its DLL graph exposed three concrete gaps:

1. CRTDLL `_vsnprintf` was missing. The bounded formatter now returns `-1`
   without a terminator on truncation, matching the Win9x CRT contract.
2. D2Sound imports authentic Win98 DSOUND ordinals 1 and 2. They now resolve
   to `DirectSoundCreate` and `DirectSoundEnumerateA`.
3. The original 64-entry synchronization table filled during startup. Storm's
   later transient `CreateEventA` returned NULL, so a one-byte MPQ member
   (`data\local\use`) reported `ERROR_HANDLE_EOF` and the game stopped in
   `Archive.cpp` line 143. A 256-entry diagnostic build showed startup fill
   every slot through `e00ff`; the final 512-entry/8 KiB table leaves space
   for the fixed pool and streaming events. The same run then read all MPQs,
   initialized DirectDraw and sound, and rendered the main menu.

The final installer-produced game screenshot is
`/private/tmp/diablo2-installed-sync512.png`: an 800x600 DirectDraw frame with
the animated Diablo II logo, Single Player button, Shareware v1.04 label and
Exit Diablo II button. `test/test-diablo2-demo-installed.js` reproduces this
from a clean profile, skips the intro with normal keyboard input, pins the
EXE/data archives, and validates those menu regions.

One non-fatal diagnostic remains: the loader's first bounded D2CMP `DllMain`
pass reports an incomplete return and the game's recovery path logs an
`SMemReAlloc()` message before normal initialization repeats successfully.
It is not present in the rendered game UI and does not prevent the menu or MPQ
streaming, but it is the next cleanup target if DLL initialization is made
fully resumable.

## Character creation and gameplay

The installed demo originally crashed immediately after confirming a new
Barbarian. A normal-input trace (Single Player, double-click Barbarian, focus
the name field, type `TEST`, press Enter) stopped at batch 588 in two adjacent
CRTDLL imports:

1. `strncmp(0x01e4face, 0x009facf4, 10)` jumped through `0x009c4d7e` to the
   fail-fast unimplemented handler.
2. After implementing that function, `_strnicmp(0x01e4f898, 0x005cb3a4,
   0x7fffffff)` did the same through `0x009c4d78`.

Both are now real cdecl handlers: `strncmp` compares unsigned bytes and both
functions stop at the first difference, a shared NUL, or the requested count;
`_strnicmp` additionally folds ASCII A-Z. Zero count returns equality without
dereferencing either pointer. `test/test-strncmp.js` pins those edge cases and
the cdecl ABI.

With both imports present, the same input sequence clears the animated Act I
loading portal and reaches the playable Rogue Encampment at batch 1600 with a
one-million-block batch budget. The retained frame is
`/private/tmp/d2world-1600.png`; it contains the Barbarian and NPC, rain,
torches, terrain, belt and skill bar, plus the red life and blue mana orbs. A
ground click later scrolls the world to the wagon without a trap; that frame is
`/private/tmp/d2world-2200.png`. `test/test-diablo2-demo-gameplay.js` reproduces
hero creation from `--app=diablo2_demo` and asserts the rendered terrain and
HUD color regions, not merely process survival.

## Performance and SIMD

The playable trace is CPU-emulation bound rather than blocked on an obvious
host-side subsystem. Over 400 seconds it made 1,754,049 Win32 API calls (about
4.4K/s), while the interpreter recorded three active cooperative guest
threads, 17,089,938 block decodes, 46,860 live-cache evictions and 1,672 full
cache clears. The page's DirectDraw path already coalesces dirty presentation
to at most one upload per animation frame. No API, audio, timer, networking or
surface-upload storm was identified.

The cache-clear pressure came from fixed reservation rather than typical
compiled size. The old allocator reserved 16KB for every compiled 4KB guest
page; a fixed-allocator sample of 795 Diablo II pages found a 2,411-byte mean,
with 78.1% fitting in 4KB, 97.1% in 8KB and 99.5% in 12KB. Compiled pages now
use 4/8/12/16KB classes, grow only when emitted code requires it, and recycle
safely retired chunks. A directory clock also makes the separate 128-index
limit explicit instead of refusing all later pages. On the final replay through
batch 1660 this reduced full resets to 13; the fixed-size trace recorded 128
resets during batches 1500–1600 alone and 1,672 by batch 2300. Because the host
load varied substantially, this establishes the cache-pressure improvement but
is not presented as a wall-clock FPS measurement.

MMX is advertised and implemented, with packed operations lowered to
WebAssembly SIMD, but this run retired exactly zero MMX instructions. Static
SIMD clusters exist in `ijl11.dll`, `binkw32.dll` and `smackw32.dll`; the active
game and DirectDraw renderer DLLs contain no credible SIMD routine. The main
EXE's three isolated SSE-looking byte sequences are low-confidence scan
coincidences, SSE is not advertised, and no SSE path executes. Implementing
more SIMD is therefore unlikely to be the first-order gameplay speedup for
this shareware build; interpreter/cache/thread efficiency is the measured
target.

## Gameplay hot-loop census

A post-cache gameplay histogram over batches 1500..1660 mapped runtime block
entries back through each PE's load delta and then checked every hot backward
edge in disassembly. The table groups blocks belonging to the same loop nest;
`top entries` is the hottest constituent block, not a sum or an instruction
count. This avoids double-counting nested loops.

| Guest instance | Runtime range | Original PE range | Top entries | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| main | `0x86e1ed..0x86e275` | d2gfx `0x100031ed..0x10003275` | 924,243 | clipped rows; inner one-source palette translation at `0x86e24e` |

| main | `0x6556a1..0x6557b5` | d2cmp `0x6fe286a1..0x6fe287b5` | 226,217 | clipped RLE row decoder; optional in-place two-input palette translation |

| main | `0x86c736..0x86c8e0`, `0x86c9a1..0x86ccff`, `0x86cdc3..0x86cff8` | d2gfx `0x10001736..0x10001ff8` | 112,010 | compressed CEL RLE renderers with unrolled LUT/blend suffixes and clipping |

Smaller measured backedges (hottest block 20K–53K) are the same classes, not a
new dominant idiom: more clipped d2gfx CEL variants (`0x86d0da..0x86d4d5`),
D2CMP state/color transforms (`0x652851..0x65294c`,
`0x653f8f..0x65408b`), EXE object/list traversals (`0x421274..0x4212c1`,
`0x4300d6..0x43049c`, `0x494b22..0x49514e`), short memory scans/fills
(`0x41fd7e..0x41fda6`, `0x4c9e2e..0x4c9e45`), and two short coordinate loops
at `0x4dea38` and `0x4deae2`. Most contain calls, pointer chasing, multiple
branches, or fixed two-dimensional control and are not safe LUT_RUN shapes.

Generalized H418 LUT_RUN removes both genuinely hot byte-translation
self-loops: d2gfx runtime `0x86e24e` and d2cmp runtime `0x655762`. In the same
160-batch main window it reduced handlers from 262,313,891 to 257,258,415
(1.93%) while processing 1,381,859 pixels. The remaining first-order local
target was the straight-line/unrolled d2gfx family, especially
`0x86c141..0x86c2e2`; it needed an unrolled-LUT recognizer, not broader
self-loop recognition.

H431 now handles that fixed-span form at decode time. It recognizes the exact
descending one-source suffix and symbolically validates MSVC's scheduled
two-source blend suffix, then continues into the ordinary outer row tail. On a
full replay of the same batches 1500..1660, main handlers fell again from
257,258,415 to 179,778,066: 77,480,349 fewer, or **30.12% beyond H418 alone**
(31.46% from the original pre-LUT 262,313,891). The d2gfx suffix landings no
longer appear in the hot-block top twenty; the jump-table and row-head blocks
at `0x86c167`, `0x86c141`, `0x86c38e` and `0x86c34d` remain, as expected,
because H431 is nonterminal and does not absorb their control flow. The batch
1652 Rogue Encampment capture remained healthy: terrain 87,447, life orb 3,612,
mana orb 2,910 and 187 quantized colors. Host load forced the replay to its
320-second cap exactly at batch 1680, so this is an instruction-count result,
not a wall-time/FPS claim.

The clipped two-source inner loop at runtime `0x86e3ca` (d2gfx original
`0x100033ca`) now uses H418 as well. Descriptor version one adds a second
advancing byte stream, an auxiliary low-byte register, an absolute table
displacement and a selector for which source cursor terminates the run. A
separate exact recognizer proves the observed `xor/xor`, two loads, `shl 8`,
three increments, 64KB blend lookup, store and `cmp source2,bound / jb` order;
the executor remains the shared universal LUT kernel.

In a fresh batches-1500..1660 profile, `0x86e3ca` fell from the prior capture's
251,520 per-pixel block entries to 26,522 budget resumptions. H418 processed
1,205,355 pixels in 96,689 aggregate runs, while the new canonical ESP load-run
recognition drove H408 2,869,328 times and removed `H343 -> H343` from the top
pairs. That fresh scene retired 145,589,954 main handlers and scored terrain
102,464, life 3,612, mana 2,910 and 189 colors. Its terrain workload differs
from the earlier H431 capture and host load exceeded 80, so neither the total
handler difference nor wall time is presented as an isolated speed percentage.

### High-level meaning of the post-LUT hot blocks

The remaining block heads are easier to understand as engine operations than
as instruction pairs. Counts in this table are correlated entries within loop
nests and therefore must not be added together.

| Operation | Current evidence | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixed-shade isometric tile blit | d2gfx `0x10001130`, runtime row heads `0x86c141` (322,448) and `0x86c167` (345,480) | Draws the 15 diamond rows through a Duff jump table. Each source palette index passes through one selected 256-byte row of the 64K table before reaching the 8bpp framebuffer. |
| Per-pixel-lit isometric tile blit | d2gfx `0x10001340`, runtime row heads `0x86c34d` (289,814) and `0x86c38e` (310,515) | Combines a tile byte with a byte from the coordinate-selected light field at `0x10014004`, using `(light << 8) + pixel` into the 64K table. This is palette lighting/shading, not a 16/32bpp arithmetic alpha blend. |
| Clipped palette blit/blend | H418 aggregate 1,205,355 pixels in 96,689 runs; d2gfx `0x100031ed`/`0x1000334d` | The same fixed-shade and per-pixel-lit operations with horizontal clipping. H418 now absorbs their actual pixel loops; the surrounding row setup remains. |
| Tile/collision mask query | EXE `0x4d8e10`, hot scan blocks `0x4d8e70..0x4d8e9f` at roughly 307K--384K entries | Finds which room rectangle contains a world coordinate, resolves that room's row-offset table, loads a 16-bit tile/collision word and applies the caller's mask. This is simulation/spatial-query work, not renderer clipping. |
| Light-grid sampling/build | EXE `0x4946cd` inner 8x8 blocks at 186,048 entries and clamped sampler `0x430df0` at about 194K | Repeatedly clamps coordinates to a 48x48 grid and copies one or four light/color bytes while constructing the small lighting grid consumed by the per-pixel tile renderer. |
| CEL/RLE expansion | d2cmp `0x6fe28465`, runtime `0x655465` at 198,960 entries | Interprets signed commands: negative values skip output or advance a row; positive values copy a literal run. Other d2gfx paths apply the LUT/light operation while decoding compressed CEL rows. |

H431 processed 11,825,842 fixed-span pixels in 718,737 invocations in this
capture. Dividing the two fixed-tile row-head counts by their 15-row shape gives
about 40.8K full-tile equivalents, only as a scale estimate because clipping
and variant dispatch make it non-exact. The important consequence is that H431
has already removed most pixel-by-pixel dispatch, so the remaining d2gfx cost
is increasingly row setup, diamond-shape jump dispatch and function control.

That changes the next optimization level. An exact full-tile handler covering
the fixed-shade and per-pixel-light variants could consume all 15 rows per call
and subsume H431 internally. Separate candidates are the room collision-mask
query, the fixed 8x8 light-grid builder and the signed D2CMP command decoder.
Those are whole engine primitives; generic `XOR -> LOAD8` or `CMP -> Jcc`
fusions would only shave pieces of all four.

### Browser CPU attribution of pixels versus row control

A subsequent Chrome/V8 sampling profile measured actual Rogue Encampment
gameplay rather than inferring native cost from handler counts. The driver did
not arm the handler histogram during the CPU window, moved the Barbarian with a
ground click, and rejected the sample until the rendered frame contained green
terrain plus both life and mana orbs. It then took a separate short histogram
window in the same live instance. Two headless runs captured 46,462 samples
over 15.53s and 34,918 samples over 10.49s. A state-aware intro driver then
repeated the measurement in a real headful/compositor-backed Chrome window:
38,251 samples over 10.43s. Host load was still high (roughly 8--14), so these
are CPU self-time shares only, not FPS or throughput measurements.

The result narrows the multi-row claim considerably:

| Native function | Headless 1 | Headless 2 | Headful | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `$next` | 22.98% | 21.53% | 22.44% | Threaded dispatch itself remains the largest single native cost. |
| H431 `$th_lut_span` | 1.68% | 1.58% | 1.97% | The already-folded fixed-span pixel kernel is no longer a dominant cost. |
| H418 `$th_lut_run` | 0.30% | 0.36% | 0.32% | Clipped palette translation/blending is smaller again. |
| all Wasm | 90.0% | 90.4% | 91.1% | Browser presentation/JS is not the principal ceiling in this capture. |

Separating samples whose ancestry goes through `thread-manager.js` puts H431
at 1.82--2.21% of main-path CPU and H418 at 0.36--0.42%; neither ran on the
worker path. Main-thread `$next` alone was 20.15--21.53%. The worker share
varied from 10.7% to 18.3% in these three windows, so the earlier larger blue
HUD share is phase-dependent rather than a fixed split.

The matched histogram explains what remains around H431. In the repeat window,
the fixed-shade row head ran 134,596 times and the per-pixel-lit row head
122,360 times, while H431 ran 265,541 times in total. Accounting for the
existing ESP load-run fusion, the two fixed-tile outer bodies represent about
5.84M row-setup/control handler dispatches out of 62.86M total (about 9.3%);
including their H431 calls makes the theoretical handler-count ceiling about
9.7%. A multi-row handler would not remove the pixel work or all address
calculation, however. At uniform dispatch cost it saves only about two points
of total CPU from `$next`; direct WAT row setup could save some additional
generic-handler cost. Consequently the honest expected ceiling is a few
percent until an A/B prototype measures it, not evidence that the outer tile
loop dominates the whole browser.

### Per-present guest-operation attribution

A temporary guest-EIP range timer measured the main instance between actual
DirectDraw presents. The steady Rogue Encampment window contains 57 frames;
menus, loading and the first loading-to-gameplay spike are excluded. A matched
empty-range control retained the frame/timer hooks but removed all hot-range
transitions. The detailed probe raised median active main-guest time from
77.96ms to 89.04ms (14.2%), so uncorrected probe time is not an honest browser
frame-time result. A standalone Wasm-to-JS timer-import calibration measured
85.7--92.4ns per transition; the full launch made 4.04M transitions.

The table reports exclusive loop-body buckets. “Adjusted” divides the raw
medians and p90s by the measured 1.142 probe inflation. It is a deterministic
Node/V8 CLI estimate of computation per DirectDraw present, not browser wall
time, and helpers outside a listed EIP range remain in `other`.

| Exclusive operation bucket | Raw median | Adjusted median | Adjusted p90 | Mean active share |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Fixed/per-pixel-lit isometric tile bodies | 12.64ms | 11.07ms | 18.47ms | 14.48% |
| Lighting-grid build/sample/interpolation | 8.75ms | 7.66ms | 11.88ms | 9.87% |
| Object/list/visible-scene traversal | 8.01ms | 7.01ms | 11.68ms | 9.32% |
| CEL renderer bodies | 7.51ms | 6.57ms | 11.69ms | 8.60% |
| Collision walk and room-mask query | 5.94ms | 5.20ms | 7.46ms | 6.56% |
| D2CMP RLE encode/decode/transform | 2.42ms | 2.12ms | 3.15ms | 3.03% |
| Clipped palette/light blits | 2.40ms | 2.10ms | 3.30ms | 2.71% |
| Nearest-palette-color search | 1.97ms | 1.72ms | 2.73ms | 2.34% |
| DirectDraw scanline loop | 0.31ms | 0.27ms | 0.40ms | 0.36% |
| Everything outside those ranges | 37.90ms | 33.18ms | 52.40ms | 42.74% |

Thus the larger named buckets are now ranked per present, but these numbers do
not prove inclusive whole-function cost or transfer directly to browser
milliseconds. The lower-overhead Chrome sampling result above remains the
browser authority: `$next` is 22.44% of total CPU while H431 and H418 themselves
are only 1.97% and 0.32%. The operation timer says where the surrounding guest
work is concentrated; it does not overturn that native attribution.

## Cooperative workers and real browser threads

The browser HUD's blue `threads` phase is literal wall time spent in
`ThreadManager.runBudgeted`, but the name does not mean Web Workers. The three
guest worker WASM instances currently run synchronously and round-robin on the
browser's main JavaScript thread. A sequential per-instance histogram over
batches 1500..1650 found:

| Instance | 50-batch handlers | Dominant work |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| T1, Fog service thread | 0 | parked in `WaitForSingleObject` |
| T2, Storm async worker | 56,384,573 | MPQ Huffman/bitstream decode and ADPCM expansion |
| T3, D2Sound worker | 53,312 | mostly waits and DirectSound service calls |

T2's hottest nests are Storm runtime `0x9a1f40..0x9a21b3` (original
`0x6ffbbf40..0x6ffbc1b3`, Huffman bit refill/tree traversal; 433,747 entries in
its hottest block) and `0x9a2d30..0x9a2e9f` (original
`0x6ffbcd30..0x6ffbce9f`, ADPCM code expansion and predictor/step-index clamps;
432,499). Its secondary loops build/walk the decode trees at
`0x9a1c40..0x9a1e6e` and perform smaller output transforms at
`0x9a31a6..0x9a31f4`. Neither is LUT_RUN, and no worker instance executed H418
during the full replay.

Consequently, real Web Workers should materially improve browser responsiveness
for this workload: nearly the entire blue phase could overlap the main guest
instead of blocking input and paint. At the sampled rates main averaged about
1.61M handlers/batch and T2 1.13M; perfect independent overlap would put a
rough upper bound near 1.7x for their combined CPU phase. That is a ceiling,
not an FPS forecast: main sometimes waits for worker events, host imports such
as audio/window/storage need a main-thread broker, shared emulator allocators
still need locking, and the green d2gfx renderer remains single-threaded. The
existing shared WASM memory, per-thread instances, atomic wait table and
partitioned decode caches provide useful groundwork; the missing broker and
race audit are the implementation cost documented in
`docs/design-real-threads.md`.

## Isolated-Worker bounded MPQ waits

The isolated browser backend originally omitted the bounded-wait poll floor
already used by the cooperative main scheduler. Its guest clock can advance
past Storm's 255ms MPQ completion wait after only one or two concurrent Worker
slices. `resolveMainWorkerWait()` then returned `WAIT_TIMEOUT` while the Storm
decompression worker was still runnable; Storm accepted the resulting short
read, and D2CMP later reported `Codec.cpp` line 1563, `top >= 0`, while decoding
the incomplete data.

`ThreadManager.resolveWait()` now requires both elapsed guest time and up to
the same bounded number of scheduler polls while an isolated main thread still
has runnable guest workers. A signal remains immediate, and a permanently
unsignalled finite wait still times out after the poll ceiling. The focused
regression advances the guest clock by 1000ms during a 255ms wait, proves it
does not complete after the second Worker slice, then signals the event and
proves normal completion.

## The Direct3D renderer (2026-09-19)

The demo ships four renderer back ends beside the executable — `d2ddraw.dll`,
`d2direct3d.dll`, `d2glide.dll`, `d2gdi.dll` — and picks one from
`HK{CU,LM}\Software\Blizzard Entertainment\Diablo II\VideoConfig`. `d2ddraw.dll`
is in the app's static import set, so watching *that* load says nothing about
the choice; the selection shows up as a runtime `[LoadLibrary]` line. Measured,
one headless run per value:

| `Render` | runtime `LoadLibrary` |
|---|---|
| 0 | none (DirectDraw) |
| **1** | **`d2direct3d.dll`** |
| 2 | none (DirectDraw) |
| 3 | `d2glide.dll` — then `UNIMPLEMENTED API: _grGet@12` |
| 4 | `d2gdi.dll` |

`DeviceName` (`"Direct3D HAL"`) and `dwFlags` do not select anything on their
own; `Render` does. The `-d3d` command-line switch does **not** reach the D3D
path — with `-d3d -w` the game loads `d2gdi.dll`. Repro:

```
node test/run.js --app=diablo2_demo --no-build --quiet-api \
  --max-batches=20000 --max-seconds=150 --reg-import=<seed>.json
```

where the seed sets `Render` = DWORD 1 under both the HKCU and HKLM key.

**The renderer is not seeded by default, and should not be**: the DirectDraw
path is what the app uses today and it works. Both failures below are on the
`Render=1` route only.

### How the value is decoded (disassembly, 2026-09-20)

Two separate numbering schemes are involved, and conflating them is the trap.

**The EXE turns `Render` into a flag byte.** `RegQueryValueEx` of the `Render`
name (string at `0x005a6e08`, its only xref) returns into a local, and the
value is then range-checked and dispatched:

```
00401b56  mov  ecx, [esp+0x10]          ; the Render DWORD
00401b5a  lea  eax, [ecx-0x1]
00401b5d  cmp  eax, 3
00401b60  ja   0x401b8f                 ; outside 1..4 -> leave every flag clear
00401b62  jmp  [0x401bbc+eax*4]         ; 4 entries: 401b69 401b73 401b7d 401b87
```

Each arm sets one byte of a five-byte flag block and falls straight out:
`Render` 1 -> `[esp+0x167]`, 2 -> `[esp+0x166]`, 3 -> `[esp+0x165]`,
4 -> `[esp+0x164]`. So the byte written is `[esp+0x168] - Render` — the block
is indexed in descending address order, which is why it does not read as an
array at a glance.

That also explains the two "none" rows in the table above without needing a
second measurement: `Render` = 0 fails the `cmp eax,3` unsigned check (it
wraps to `0xFFFFFFFF`) and sets nothing at all, so the game keeps the
DirectDraw default.

The same block is read back at `0x401a90` *before* the registry is consulted —
bytes `0x165`, `0x164`, `0x166` and `0x168` are each tested and any one of them
set jumps past the registry read entirely. Those are the command-line
overrides, which is why a switch beats the registry rather than merging with
it. The switch names live in a table of `{UPPER, lower, group, id}` records at
`0x005a60e0` (`3DFX`/`3dfx`, `OPENGL`/`opengl`, `D3D`/`d3d`, ... all in group
`VIDEO`), and its ids are **not** `Render` values — do not read the mapping off
that table.

**D2gfx has its own, different numbering.** The backend DLL name is fetched in
`d2gfx.dll` at `0x1000381a`:

```
10003817  mov  eax, [0x1000d1bc+edi*4]  ; edi = video mode
1000381e  cmp  eax, ebx                 ; ebx = 0
10003826  jnz  short 0x10003841
10003829  push 0x1000d2cc               ; "Unsupported video mode - %d"
```

The name table at `0x1000d1bc` is sparse, and its indices are the *video mode*,
not `Render`:

| index | `[0x1000d1bc + i*4]` |
|---:|---|
| 0 | NULL |
| 1 | `D2Gdi.dll` |
| 2 | NULL |
| 3 | `D2DDraw.dll` |
| 4 | `D2Glide.dll` |
| 5 | NULL |
| 6 | `D2Direct3D.dll` |

A NULL entry is the error path above, not a fallback. Three function pointers
sit immediately before the names at `0x1000d1b0` (`0x100029e0`, `0x10002ba0`,
`0x10002de0`), and the selected mode is published to `[0x1001c048]`.

**Reading which backend won, at runtime.** `d2ddraw.dll` is in the app's static
import set, so it is loaded on every route and grepping a log for it proves
nothing — the choice appears only as a runtime `LoadLibrary` of
`d2direct3d.dll` / `d2glide.dll` / `d2gdi.dll`. That load also happens well
after the first frames: it is absent from a 130-batch run even on a seed that
demonstrably ends up in Direct3D, so any probe short of the menu reports
"DirectDraw" for every value. Give it the full 20000-batch run in the repro
above before believing a row.

### Our 8 MB video-memory report makes the game wipe its own code

With the stock report, `Render=1` dies at ~batch 3380 executing zeros at
`d2direct3d+0x929b`, with every register zero. The image is *not* corrupt when
that batch begins — a `dump-mem` of the same address at batches 3000/3100/3200/
3300 shows the real instructions — and `--fault-null` names the culprit in one
line: **561,098,735 unmapped guest accesses from one EIP**, sweeping
`0x0`–`0xfffffffc`. It is a `rep stosd` clearing the whole address space, and it
reaches `d2direct3d`'s own `.text` on the way.

The count comes from a **signed** divide, at `d2direct3d.dll+0x9260`
(original base `0x10000000`):

```
mov  ebx, [0x1001aa88]      ; bytes per pixel
imul ebx, [esp+0x10]        ; * width
imul ebx, [esp+0x14]        ; * height      -> texture size in bytes
mov  eax, [esp+0xc]
sub  eax, edx               ; a video-memory budget, minus a reserve
cdq
idiv ebx                    ; slots = budget / texture size   (SIGNED)
...
shl  eax, 5
mov  ebp, eax
call <alloc>                ; ebp bytes
mov  edi, eax
shr  ecx, 2
rep  stosd                  ; memset of ebp bytes
```

`--trace-at=d2direct3d+0x1000929b` catches it with `EBP=0xfff5c200` — a
negative byte count, i.e. a negative slot count, i.e. the budget came out
below the reserve. `$handle_IDirectDraw2_GetAvailableVidMem` and the two
`GetCaps` sites in `src/09a8-handlers-directx.wat` all report a **8 MB** card
(`0x00800000`), and that is the number feeding this divide.

### Raising it trades the wipe for a texture-slot ceiling

Rebuilt with 64 MB in those five constants, the wipe is gone — and the game
then creates **4094 surfaces against 1 release** before
`IDirectDraw_CreateSurface` fails and it asserts
`C:\D2\Source\D2Direct3D\Src\d3dSprite.cpp, line #85, Expression: success`.
4096 is our DX object-table size, so the cache D2 sizes from the report simply
does not fit. 52 MB asserts in the same place, so this is not a matter of
finding a number between the two failures; the slot table is the next wall.

Nothing else in the corpus is sensitive to the constant: MechCommander — the
app whose `GetCaps` budget comment the 8 MB figure was written for — renders
**pixel-identical** (0 of 307200 pixels differ) at 8 MB and at 64 MB.

So the D3D route needs two things, in this order: a video-memory report that is
not a lie about a 1998 card, and a DX object table that can hold the cache that
report implies. Neither is worth landing until both are done, because each one
alone only moves the crash.

### Resolved 2026-09-19: it is one constant of D2's, read twice

The guess above was close but the mechanism is more specific, and knowing it
turns the tuning into arithmetic.

`d2direct3d` sizes its texture caches in the function whose arena carve begins
at `+0x1000271a`. It reads **`[0x10019968]` — the `dwFree` out-parameter of the
second `GetAvailableVidMem` call, the one asking for `DDSCAPS_NONLOCALVIDMEM`
(AGP) texture memory** — into `edi`, and clamps it to its own hardcoded
`cmp edi, 0x2000000` ceiling. Everything follows from that one value:

* `edi` is the arena **end**. Each cache gets a slice of `edi - base`, and
  `+0x10009260` computes `slots = (end - base) / (bpp*w*h)` with a **signed**
  `idiv`, stores it, then `shl eax,5` and `rep stosd`s `slots*32` bytes.
* Answer **0** and `slots` goes negative. Measured at the fatal call: base
  `0x022f8000`, end `0x00000000`, `slots = -17888`, `slots*32 = 0xfff74200`,
  so the `rep stosd` at `+0x1000929b` walks ~4 GB. That is the 561M-unmapped-
  access wipe above; the all-zero `ESP=0` dump is a consequence, not a clue,
  because the register file lives in memory and the stosd went through it.
* We answered 0 because `free = total - used` and **D2 sizes its caches twice,
  never releasing the first round**. 8 MB and 16 MB produce byte-identical
  traces — the first round succeeds (`EDI=0x00ed4000`), the second gets 0.
* The 32 MB ceiling also explains the 4094 above: a full 32 MB arena is about
  179 tiles of 256x256, 97 of 128x128 and 3276 of 32x32 — roughly 3550 — so
  two rounds overflow a 4096-slot table. **No report makes D2 ask for more**,
  which is what makes the table size a finite answer rather than a guess.

The other ceiling is ours: every surface is really a DIB in `$DIB_BACKING_BASE`
(63 MB), and page rounding plus the `pitch*16+64` slack row costs 1.09x for
256x256, 1.25x for 128x128 and **2.0x** for 32x32 — weighted about **1.29x** of
what we promise. Measured: 64 MB and 48 MB both fill the arena exactly
(`pages used 16384 free 0`), surfaces come back with `dib=0xf0` and
`CreateSurface` fails into the same `d3dSprite.cpp:85` assert — the same
message as slot exhaustion, from a completely different cause.

Landed: `$DX_VIDMEM_TOTAL` = **40 MB** (one named constant replacing the six
scattered literals) and `$DX_MAX` = **8192** with its seven sibling regions.
At 40 MB the first round gets D2's full 32 MB ceiling, the second gets 8 MB,
and the arena settles at `pages used 14977 free 1407`. **No wipe, no assert,
687 live surfaces, and the screen goes from desktop teal to black** — D2 owns
the display and clears it.

Open, and the next lead: it clears but never draws. 120000 batches at
`--batch-size=200000` finish in 24s with a uniformly black frame, so it is idle
rather than working. The wipe and the assert are both gone; what remains is a
present/draw question, not a memory one.

### 2026-09-20: it is not a draw question — the game is spinning, forever

"Clears but never draws" was the wrong reading, and it is worth saying why it
was convincing: the frame is black, nothing is presented, and a fixed batch
budget finishes in the usual wall time. All three are equally true of a guest
executing a two-instruction loop it can never leave, because **batches retire
normally while the guest makes no progress** — a batch is a budget of blocks,
and a tight loop retires blocks as fast as anything else.

Driving the verified route (SINGLE PLAYER, Barbarian, name, OK — see
*Character creation and gameplay*) to Act I on `Render=1` and taking a
snapshot at the black frame puts EIP at **`d2direct3d+0x10009561`**, inside
the texture cache's eviction loop. Disassembled, that loop cannot terminate
for the state it is in:

```
10009561  cmp  [ecx+0x4], esi      ; esi==0 here: count == 0 ?
10009564  jz   0x100095c0          ;   ... then skip the evict AND the dec
          <evict the LRU item>
100095bd  dec  [ecx+0x4]           ; count--
100095c0  mov  eax, [ecx+0x4]      ; count
100095c3  mov  edx, [ecx]          ; nMaxNumItems
100095c5  cmp  eax, edx
100095c7  jz   0x10009561          ; full? evict again
```

With `count == 0` the body is skipped *including the decrement*, and with
`nMaxNumItems == 0` the exit test `count == nMaxNumItems` is always true. A
cache of capacity zero is simultaneously empty and full, so the loop evicts
nothing and re-tests forever. It writes no memory, so nothing in a snapshot
changes and every heuristic that looks for progress reports "idle".

The state was read straight out of the live hang rather than inferred
(`exports.get_ecx()` → the cache, then its first six fields):

```
eip=17d0561  ecx=17f2218  nMaxNumItems=0  count=0  head=7ee30604  tail=7ee305e4
```

`head`/`tail` are real heap pointers, so this cache *had* been populated: the
capacity was zeroed by a later re-size, not left uninitialized from the start.
That matches the two-round behaviour documented above — the second round is
carved from a `dwFree` we have already billed the first round against — and it
means the remaining work is still the video-memory question, not a draw one.

Two things make this newly tractable:

* **The three caches are one global each**, at `d2direct3d+0x1002b218`
  (256x256), `+0x1002b234` (128x128) and `+0x1002b250` (32x32), 0x1c apart,
  laid out `[nMaxNumItems, count, freeHead, freeTail, lruHead, lruTail,
  items]` with 32-byte items. They are passed by pointer, so a VA xref scan
  shows only loads and `mov ecx, imm` — there are no stores to find, which is
  what made the initializer look absent.
* **Both `GetAvailableVidMem` calls are visible in the init**, and they ask
  for *different pools*: `d2direct3d+0x1000248b` passes
  `dwCaps = 0x10005000` (`LOCALVIDMEM|VIDEOMEMORY|TEXTURE`) and
  `+0x1000252e` passes `0x20005000` (`NONLOCALVIDMEM|…`, i.e. AGP), into
  separate `dwTotal`/`dwFree` pairs at `0x10019964/68` and `0x1001996c/70`.
  D2 then takes `edi = max(localFree, min(agpFree, 32 MB))` as the arena end.
  `$handle_IDirectDraw2_GetAvailableVidMem` ignores `lpDDSCaps` entirely and
  answers both from one pool, so a first round billed against local memory
  also shrinks the AGP answer the second round depends on. On real hardware
  those are physically distinct memories and the second answer does not move.

A probe for this is `tools/ctl.js eval`, whose scope now carries `va()` and
`mods` so `va("d2direct3d+0x1002b218")` resolves against the load address this
run happened to pick. Reading a guest module's global used to mean grepping
the run log for its load line and pasting a base into the expression, which is
silently wrong on the next run — a bad base still reads *some* memory and
returns plausible numbers.
