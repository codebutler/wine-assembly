# Anachronox demo (Ion Storm / Eidos 2001)

Registry id `anachronox_demo`. Role-playing game on a heavily extended
Quake II engine: `anox.exe` + `gamex86.dll` + `anoxgfx.dll`, renderer
`ref_gl.dll` (OpenGL only -- there is no ref_soft), Miles audio (`mss32.dll`
plus every `.m3d` provider in `ANOXDATA\MILES`), and game logic in
`ANOXDATA\PLUGINS\*.dll` (loaded in `dllorder.txt` order; `ui.dll` is a debug
build). Fixture: `test/binaries/win98-games-a-d/Anachronox-Demo-SW-OpenGL`
(InstallShield 6 cabinets); the unpacked tree is
`Anachronox-Demo-SW-OpenGL-installed/anoxdemo` (the setup's default
`C:\AnoxDemo`, 99 MB).

## Install

InstallShield 6 runs its engine (`ikernel.exe`) as an out-of-process COM
server, which the emulator does not provide ("Setup failed to launch
installation engine"). The cabinets were unpacked instead:
`node tools/is-cab.js <fixture> --extract=OUT` (114 files, every one
MD5-verified). The installer's own support files (`ctor.dll`, `objectps.dll`,
`iuser.dll`, `iscript.dll`, `isrt.dll`, `_IsRes.dll`, `setup.*`,
`value.shl`, `default.pal`, `corecomp.ini`) were left out. The setup would
also write `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Eidos Interactive\Anachronox Demo`; the game runs
without it.

## Running it

- Working directory must be `c:\anoxdemo`: the engine opens
  `anoxdata\*.dat` relative to it (with `C:\` every pack fails to open).
- `anoxgfx.dll`, `gamex86.dll` and `MSVCRT.DLL` load as real PEs (the
  entry's `dlls:`); without them `_PH_Get_Argc_Argv@12` falls to a stub.
- Args are `anox_640gl.bat`'s (fullscreen 640x480 GL). The windowed
  `anox_window.bat` args give a 646x507 framed window that a 640x480 capture
  crops.
- **Headless needs `--gl-renderer=software`.** Without a GL context
  (`--headless-gl` with no native deps) `wglCreateContext` fails and the game
  says "Couldn't load renderer!".
- GL entry points it needed beyond the measured set: `glColor3ub` (GL op
  111, HUD/font colours).
- Mouse is a pointer-lock/`GetCursorPos`+`SetCursorPos` centring loop (no
  DirectInput): drive menus with `relmousemove:DX:DY` (1:1 pixels; the cursor
  starts at about (10,0)); `mousedown:X:Y`/`mouseup` at the cursor's position
  clicks. Esc skips the title logo.

Route (CLI, default tick): "One Moment" -> 3D title logo -> Esc at ~205k
batches -> main menu; New Universe at (265,140) -> "Democratus: Town of
Whitendon" loading screen for ~150k batches -> the opening scene in Fatima's
room with her dialogue "Hi there." (~437k). Batches cost ~0.75 s each in the
world (software GL at 640x480 plus the debug-build UI), against ~1 ms in the
menu.

## Dialogue: click with the game's cursor over the box (solved 2026-10-06)

The opening dialogue was never stuck; the harness clicked in a way the game
cannot see. Measured on boat bx_yg8qxb66 with `--count` slots armed live from
`ctl.js eval` (`exports.set_count` on the main and every thread instance):

- While a dialogue window is open the game context stack is `64,1`
  (gamex86 `GAME_GetContext`, stack at `[0x10029724]`; ui.dll pushes 0x40 when
  it opens a window at `0x10006d43` and pops it in `0x10006377`).
  `selectforward` (ui `0x100045b1`, Space) only acts in context 1, so Space and
  Enter are inert during dialogue by design.
- A line advances through the click handler `0x1000553f` (100 ms debounce on
  `ATime_GetTotalMsec`, then `0x1000535d`), but only while a dialogue window
  has focus: `[0x100e8eb8]` (window id) and `[0x100e8eb4]` (index) are set by
  the picker `0x10005e90`, which hit-tests the game's **virtual cursor**
  (`[0x100f2104]+0x140`, `[0x100f2100]+0xf0`) against the window rectangle.
- The mouse is a recentring loop, so `run.js mousedown:X:Y` at any point but
  the centre reads as a jump: after the first click the cursor sat at (0,0) or
  (162,0), outside the box, focus dropped to -1 and later clicks were ignored.

**Route through it:** one `relmousemove` to put the cursor inside the box
(e.g. `relmousemove:200:60` from the top-left), then for every line
`mousedown:320:240`, ~40 batches, `mouseup:320:240`, ~500 batches. Clicking at
the recentre point adds no motion (the cursor drifts 1-2 px per click). That
walks Fatima's intro to "Cue the snow."; the context then becomes 256 for the
snow/mansion cinematic, which plays by itself in ~70k batches; John's lines in
town take ~9 more clicks; then the context returns to 1 and Boots is under
player control: holding Up (`+forward`) walks him up the street, while 1500
idle batches leave him beside John.
Evidence: `scratch/runs/20261006T1940Z-anachronox_demo-gameplay-w6`.

## Earlier investigation: the opening dialogue "never advances" (parked 2026-10-06)

Kept for the measurements; the cause is the cursor, above.

The opening scene in Fatima's room shows her line "Hi there." and stays on it.
Measured on two runs (one ctl session to 434k, one scripted to 440k):

- Batches in the scene are fast (~300 per few seconds); the ~0.75 s/batch
  seen on the first visit did not recur.
- The in-world cursor follows `relmousemove` (input reaches the game).
- Nothing advances the line: Space (bound to `selectforward` in
  `ANOXDATA\CONFIGS\default.cfg`), left clicks on the box and on Fatima, Enter,
  F1 (`fatstat goals`) -- over ~10k batches.

Ruled out, with how:

- **RSX 3D provider timer.** Its 11 ms `timeSetEvent` callback
  (`mssrsx+0x22d0cda0`) fires once because RSX itself calls
  `timeKillEvent(1)`: Miles opens each 3D provider, probes it and closes it.
  The callback returned normally (`--count` on its unlock landing).
- **A wedged Miles mixer.** The DirectSound mixer timer
  (mss32 `0x211136e0`, 10 ms, timer table at runtime `0x021325cc`) runs: a
  `--watch-log` on its `lock inc`/`lock dec` re-entrancy counter
  (`[0x2114f8cc]`, runtime `0x1e338cc`) shows ~23k clean 0->1->0 passes on
  thread T1 in 30k batches. Single memory dumps catch it at 1 because they land
  mid-pass -- do not read a dump of that counter as "stuck".

- **Silent audio.** Sound mixes: thread T1 makes ~314k
  `IDirectSoundBuffer_GetCurrentPosition` and ~119k `Lock` calls per 60k
  batches. An earlier "zero DirectSound calls in the scene" was a tracing hole,
  not a finding: a guest thread's COM calls were logged as `<ord>` (and dropped
  entirely under `--quiet-api`), so no `--trace-api=NAMES` filter matched them.
  Fixed in the same commit as this note; a trace run before it says nothing
  about guest threads.

Next lead: read how `ui.dll`'s dialogue code decides a line is finished
(`UI_StartTalk`, `ui_skipscene`, `A3SV_Playback_Skip`; scripted playback is
`A3SV_Playback_*` in `planet.dll`). `anoxsnd.dll` polls `AIL_sample_status` /
`AIL_sample_ms_position`, so a voice sample that plays but never reports done
is still possible.

## Named addresses

- `ui.dll` (base 0x10000000) `0x1000de20`: sweeps the 8192-entry widget table
  at `0x100e8f60` (then `0x10055de0`) freeing every entry owned by its
  argument; the hottest code on the Whitendon loading screen.
