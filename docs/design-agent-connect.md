# Connect an Agent: pair any AI agent to a running game over WebRTC

Status: DESIGN. Builds on [design-agent-control.md](design-agent-control.md)
(the command protocol, `lib/agent-remote.js`, `tools/ctl.js`) and on
[virtual-lan-party.md](virtual-lan-party.md) (`lib/vlan-rtc.js`: WebRTC
through the berrry store, secretbox envelopes).

## The problem

An agent can drive a page today only if `tools/dev-server.js` serves the page and the
agent is on the same machine, or if the user pastes a console snippet. Neither works
for someone playing on berrry.app on their phone who wants *their own* agent to play
along, whichever agent that is. This design makes it a Start-menu feature:

- **Any agent:** Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, OpenHands, a home-made script.
  Nothing is vendor-specific and nothing depends on MCP.
- **Nothing to install:** the agent reads plain instructions from the website (an
  [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) folder) and downloads one script itself,
  the way it would follow any README.
- **One paste:** the player copies one link into the agent. Nothing is pasted back.
- **No player account:** the agent registers itself through berrry's existing
  self-serve nomcp agent registration, and the page never writes to berrry.
- **Peer to peer:** commands and screenshots travel over a WebRTC DataChannel and
  never touch berrry.

## TL;DR

In `body.single-app` mode the Start menu is hidden while an app runs. A session
started on the phone's desktop stays reachable mid-game through its floating chip, but
there is no way yet to *start* one once a game is up.

```

- **Copy** copies the whole sentence, so the one paste is also the instruction.
- **Share** (`navigator.share`) is the phone path: the player is on the phone and the
  agent is on a laptop, so the link has to leave the phone somehow. There is no QR code,
  since a laptop can't usefully scan one.
- The last line covers agents that installed the skill once: they need only the
  bare `wa1.…` token.
- The page enforces the permission checkboxes (`execEntry` refuses a disallowed
  verb). The agent never enforces them.

The name and key come from the bot's signature inside the sealed answer (see Storage),
and only the key is trusted. The "runs as" label is self-reported, shown as a
convenience, and marked as such. A remembered key shows "(known since Sep 30)".

The Connected dialog sketched above was built first and then replaced by the chip
menu: a window open over the game for the whole session was in the way, and the same
model also carries the recording chip and the LAN room's 🌐 chip. The floating strip
dims after 3 s with no news and never resizes the game. It lives in the DOM, and both
agent screenshots and the recorder read the canvas, so it is in neither picture.

- "Take back" is the existing `user-input on` path in `lib/agent-remote.js` (input
  exclusivity). It doesn't disconnect, and the agent receives `{event:'user-took-input'}`.
- Esc is **not** a take-back key, because games use Esc.
- Minimizing the pairing dialog leaves the waiting chip. Reloading or closing the page ends the
  session, and a new link is needed.

## 2. What the agent reads: the skill

 repo root AGENTS.md stays as it is: it is about working ON the repo, and is unrelated.
```

The name is `wine-assembly-connect`, not `connect`, so it can't collide with other skills
in an agent's installed set. The folder is plain static files in this repo, deployed
with the site.

### SKILL.md, in outline

```markdown
---
name: wine-assembly-connect
description: Connect to and play a Windows 98 game or app running in someone's
  browser on wine-assembly.berrry.app. Use when given a link or token starting "wa1.".
---
# Connect to a wine-assembly game

The token is the part after `#` in the link you were given (starts `wa1.`). It's a
secret: don't post it anywhere. It expires in 10 minutes and works once.

## Which tier are you?
- You can run shell commands and `node --version` is 18+  → Tier 1
- You can run shell commands, no node                     → Tier 1b (not yet available)
- You can only fetch URLs                                  → Tier 2 (not yet available);
  tell the user you cannot connect, and why.

## Tier 1
1. curl -fsSLO https://wine-assembly.berrry.app/skills/wine-assembly-connect/scripts/wine-agent.mjs
   check: shasum -a 256 wine-agent.mjs  →  <hash>
2. node wine-agent.mjs 'wa1.…'   (keep it running, e.g. in the background)
   expected output, first run only:  REGISTER http://127.0.0.1:PORT/register  (a puzzle)
   expected output, always:          READY http://127.0.0.1:PORT  key=<secret>
3. Wait for the player to click Allow  →  GET /status says "connected".
4. Loop: GET /screenshot.png → look → POST /click … → GET /screenshot.png …
Every request needs the header  Authorization: Bearer <secret from READY>.

## How to play well
(short version of reference/playing.md: coordinates are guest-screen pixels;
screenshot after every action; use /frozen + /step for timed games; press and
release as separate requests with a step between for games that sample the mouse
once per frame; stop and ask the player if a dialog you don't understand appears)
```

The instructions are imperative steps, each with its expected output, so an agent can
tell success from failure without guessing. No vendor names and no tool-call syntax.

### Capability tiers

```
 TIER 1   shell + node ≥18   wine-agent.mjs      WebRTC P2P      prototype scope
 TIER 1b  shell, no node     prebuilt binary     WebRTC P2P      later (bun --compile)
 TIER 2   fetch URLs only    berrry HTTP relay   via berrry      later, berrry change 8
                             (GET-only commands, since many web agents can't POST)
```

### The bridge's local API (tier 1)

The bridge listens on `127.0.0.1` only, on a random port, and requires the bearer secret
it prints at startup (so a web page in the user's own browser can't reach it through
DNS rebinding or a cross-site request). It rejects any Host header other than
`127.0.0.1:<port>`.

```
 GET  /status                 → {state: waiting|asking|connected|closed, bot, rtt}
 GET  /register               → the nomcp captcha puzzle (first run only)
 POST /register               {answer, username}           username must end in "bot"
 GET  /screenshot.png         → image/png (guest screen, native resolution)
 GET  /snapshot               → windows, focus, last MessageBox text, app, frozen, step
 POST /click                  {x, y, button?}      POST /dblclick  {x, y}
 POST /mouse                  {x, y, down|up|move}
 POST /key                    {vk}                 keydown + keyup
 POST /type                   {text}               keydown/keypress/keyup per char
 POST /drag                   {x1, y1, x2, y2}
 POST /frozen                 {on}                 POST /step {n}
 GET  /apps                   POST /launch {app}
 POST /cmd                    {raw}                any --input action, the escape hatch
 POST /disconnect
```

Each endpoint maps one-to-one onto the existing command vocabulary in
[design-agent-control.md](design-agent-control.md), so `reference/api.md` and
`tools/ctl.js` describe the same verbs.

 └───────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┴────────────┴───────────────┘
```

### The token (page → agent, the single paste)

The page's offer travels inside the token, which is why the page never writes to berrry.
A full SDP is 1-3 KB, but only a few fields matter, so the token carries a minimal
binary encoding, and the bridge re-expands it into a standard SDP:

```
 wa1.<base64url of>
 ┌────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────┬───────────┬──────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
 │ver │mailbox id│   key    │expires │ ice-ufrag │ ice-pwd  │ DTLS sha-256 │ candidates  │
 │ 1B │   16B    │   32B    │  4B    │   ≤8B     │  ≤24B    │     32B      │ n × 7B      │
 └────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────┴───────────┴──────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘
   candidate = type(1: host/srflx/relay) + IPv4(4) + port(2); IPv6 later
   ≈ 150 B for 3 candidates → ≈ 200 chars of base64url
```

- The token sits in the URL **fragment** (`#wa1.…`). Browsers and HTTP clients never send
  a fragment, so fetching `SKILL.md` doesn't leak it to berrry, Cloudflare or any log.
- `mailbox id` and `key` are fresh random bytes per pairing. The key is used directly
  (secretbox, 32 bytes), with no derivation: at 256 bits, offline guessing of a copied
  record is impossible.
- The page's DTLS fingerprint is in the token, so the bridge verifies it is talking to
  *that* page. There's no man in the middle even if berrry were hostile.
- The page gathers ICE (host + STUN srflx) *before* showing the link, so there is no
  trickle ICE. It reuses `gathered()` from `lib/vlan-rtc.js`.
- The token will sit in the agent's chat transcript. That's acceptable: it expires,
  the page's `RTCPeerConnection` accepts one answer, and even a live token that got
  captured still has to get past the Allow button.

### The answer record (agent → page, via berrry)

```
 berrry app data, app = wine-assembly, owner = the agent's bot user
 key:        agentpair:<mailbox id, hex>         visibility=public
 value:      { v: 1, iv: <24B b64url>, ct: <b64url> }         ≤ 2 KB
 ct = secretbox(key, {
        answer:  { ufrag, pwd, fingerprint, candidates }   (same minimal encoding)
        bot:     { username: "wanderbot", pub: <ed25519 hex>, runsAs: "Codex CLI" }
        sig:     ed25519(bot secret, "wa1-answer|" + mailbox id + "|" + answer fingerprint)
      })
```

- The page finds the record with `GET /api/public-data/users/agentpair:<id>` (an anonymous
  read that already exists; `SignalingClient.publishers()` in `lib/vlan-rtc.js` already
  handles the Cloudflare `fresh=` cache-busting). It doesn't need the bot's user id.
- Anyone could publish under that key, but nobody can guess `<id>` without the token, and
  nobody can make a record that opens without the key. The page takes the first one that
  opens *and* verifies.
- The signature binds the bot's long-lived key to this one handshake. That's what makes
  "wanderbot · key 7f3a…" verifiable and "Remember this agent" meaningful. `runsAs`
  is inside the signed envelope but is still only the bot's own claim.
- The bridge sends `DELETE /api/data/agentpair:<id>` once the channel opens. A record
  orphaned by a failed pairing lingers until TTL (optional change 5). The page ignores
  records for expired tokens, so an orphan is garbage and never a hazard.

### Agent disk (written by the bridge)

```
 ~/.config/wine-agent/identity.json   (0600)
   { username: "wanderbot", ed25519: { pub, secret }, registeredAt }
 ~/.config/wine-agent/session.json    (0600)
   { token: "brry_rw_…", expiresAt }   ← nomcp /auth/sign-in, 24h, refreshed silently
```

The first run has no identity, so the bridge prints `REGISTER …` and serves the nomcp
captcha puzzle at `GET /register`. The agent solves it and `POST`s the answer. That's
the flow berrry's nomcp registration was built for, and it doesn't assume any
particular agent.

### Page localStorage (conveniences only, every access in try/catch)

```
 wa.agent.known         [{ pub, username, firstSeen, lastSeen }]   ("Remember this agent")
 wa.agent.perms         last checkbox state
```

An empty or blocked store only means "(new agent)" and default checkboxes.

### The wire (after pairing)

```
 RTCDataChannel 'agent', ordered + reliable (commands must not reorder)
   bridge → page   {id, action, args}        | [ ...array = a stream, as today ]
   page   → bridge {id, ok, value}
   page   → bridge {event: 'user-took-input' | 'mode' | 'app-launched' | 'bye', ...}
   large replies (png): {id, chunk: i, of: n, data}  16 KB frames, reassembled by id
```

This is the same protocol as the dev-server hub. The only change in `lib/agent-remote.js`
is a transport seam, `HubPoll | RtcChannel`, in front of the existing `execEntry`, so
frozen mode, `step`, `record`, `user-input` and `launch` all carry over.

## 4. Required berrry changes

Scope: `../berrry-server`. Nomcp self-serve registration (`src/nomcp.js`:
`/register/challenge`, `/register/solve`, `/auth/sign-in`) and the app data store
(`src/backend-api/routes.js`: `/api/data/*`, `/api/public-data/*`) both exist. The gap is
that they don't connect:

```
 nomcp session token  brry_rw_…  ──►  /api/nomcp/<token>/*   ✅ (tokenAuth, api_keys lookup)
                                 ──►  /api/data/*            ❌ authenticateToken only
                                                                 accepts a JWT
```

### Required (tier 1)

**1. `authenticateToken` accepts an API key as a Bearer token.**
`src/unified-auth-middleware.js`: when the Bearer value parses as `brry_rw_…`, look it
up in `api_keys` with the same query nomcp's `tokenAuth` uses. Factor that query into one
shared function, so "valid, unrevoked, unexpired, user not disabled" has a single
definition. Then set `ctx.state.user` the same way the JWT path does, plus
`ctx.state.viaApiKey = { id, scopes, app_id }`.

**2. A data scope, checked on the data routes.**
Session tokens from `/auth/sign-in` carry `['apps:read','apps:write']` today. Add
`data:rw`, and have `/api/data/*` require it **when the caller came in via an API key**
(the JWT path is unchanged). A key with `api_keys.app_id` set is limited to that app.
The column already exists.

**3. App context for a non-browser caller.**
The bridge calls `https://wine-assembly.berrry.app/api/data/agentpair:<id>` from Node,
with no cookies. `requireAppContext` must resolve the app from the Host subdomain alone.
**Verify first**, because it may already work.

**4. Abuse limits for bot writes.**
A per-key rate limit on `/api/data` writes (e.g. 30/min) and a value-size cap for API-key
callers (2 KB is plenty here). Bots are cheap to register behind a captcha, so this
bounds what one bot can do to one app's store.

### Optional

**5. Record TTL:** `POST /api/data/:key?visibility=public&ttl=600`, so orphaned
`agentpair:*` records vanish on their own.

**6. Service document:** mention the data API and the `data:rw` scope in the nomcp HTML
service document, so generic agents discover it.

**7. Push instead of poll:** the page polls `public-data/users/agentpair:<id>` about once a
second for at most 10 minutes per pairing. An SSE endpoint for a single key would remove that.

**8. HTTP relay (tier 2, for fetch-only agents):** `GET /api/relay/<id>/<verb>?…`, a
capability-URL command queue. The page long-polls it and the agent issues GETs, with
screenshots stored briefly for the agent to fetch. This is the dev-server hub moved to production.
It carries every screenshot through berrry, so it needs its own bandwidth and abuse
limits. It's deliberately out of the prototype.

### Not needed

- No player auth change: the player stays anonymous.
- No wine-assembly-specific code on berrry: changes 1-4 read as "nomcp agents can
  use an app's data API", which any berrry app can use.
- No TURN server for v1 (see Open questions).

### Local development mirror

`tools/dev-server.js` already implements `/api/data` and `/api/public-data` in memory with
no login. It gains one rule: accept any `Bearer brry_…` as a fixed test bot user. The whole
pairing then runs on one machine with no berrry account and no network.

## 5. Pieces to build

```
 [1] lib/agent-pair.js       token + minimal-SDP pack/unpack, seal/open, sig verify.
                             Pure functions, shared by the page and the bridge
 [2] tools/dev-server.js     Bearer brry_* test bot on the in-memory store
 [3] skills/wine-assembly-connect/scripts/wine-agent.mjs
                             source in tools/wine-agent/, bundled (werift + [1]) into one
                             file; nomcp register/sign-in; localhost API (section 2)
 [4] lib/agent-remote.js     transport seam: HubPoll (existing) | RtcChannel (new)
 [5] index.html              Start item, pairing/consent dialog, 🤖 session chip
 [6] skills/…/SKILL.md, reference/*.md, /llms.txt
 [7] tools/deploy-berrry.js  include skills/ and llms.txt in the deploy set (verify: it
                             walks lib/ and src/ today)
 [8] tools/ctl.js            -s rtc:wa1.… reuses [3] (developer path)
 [9] tests                   test-agent-pair.js: token/SDP/seal round-trips, no browser
                             test-web-agent-connect.js: puppeteer page + bridge against the
                             dev-server mirror, SKILL.md steps followed literally,
                             click → screenshot round trip
```

Prototype order: [1] → [2] → [3] against a puppeteer page → [4] → [5] → [6] → berrry 1-4.
Everything up to [6] runs on the dev-server mirror before any berrry change lands.

### Status (2026-09-30): [1]-[7] and [9] built, [8] not started

```
 lib/agent-pair.js            [1]  token, minimal SDP, seal/open, frames
 tools/dev-server.js          [2]  /api/nomcp/* mirror + Bearer brry_ on /api/data
 tools/wine-agent/            [3]  wine-agent.js (source), build.js (esbuild → one file,
                                   --check), size-report.js; own package.json, so the
                                   repo root's node_modules is never touched
 skills/…/scripts/            [3]  wine-agent.mjs 1033 KB (werift 459 KB of it) + sums
 lib/agent-connect.js         [4]  the page side, a controller the UI only views. [4]
                                   became a new module rather than a transport seam in
                                   agent-remote.js: that file only gained runCommands()
                                   and commandNeeds()
 lib/agent-connect-ui.js      [5]  the pairing and consent dialogs, then the 🤖 chip;
                                   loaded on first click. index.html gained one Start item
 lib/session-chips.js              session chips: tray or floating strip, Win98 menus;
                                   also used by lib/recorder.js (● REC)
 skills/…/SKILL.md, reference/ [6] plus root SPEC.md (→ llms.txt)
 tools/deploy-berrry.js       [7]  ships skills/ (.md .mjs .txt)
 test/test-agent-pair.js      [9]  8 checks, no browser
 test/test-web-agent-connect.js    46 checks: real Chrome ⇄ the shipped bridge over a
                                   real DataChannel, via the controller API and then
                                   through the Start menu; screenshots in
                                   build/agent-connect/
```

Decisions made while building, which the sections above don't show:

- **Drive mode takes the input on the agent's first control command.** `agent-connect.js`
  decides that per command. `agent-remote.js`'s auto-engage is one-shot per page: a
  manual Take back retires it for the page's life, so a second session would otherwise
  never block the player's input.
- **The bridge waits 300 ms before closing its peer connection** on `/disconnect`.
  Closing immediately dropped the queued `bye`, and the page then waited out an ICE
  timeout before it noticed.
- **The public row's owner fields name the bot.** That's store metadata, not ours to
  hide. It's readable only by someone who already holds the token (the record key
  derives from it), and the sealed `value` itself carries nothing readable.
- **Chrome ⇄ werift interop works with Chrome's mDNS host candidates** on one machine.
  Across two machines on different networks it's still unmeasured (open question 1).

### Consent must not consume the ICE timeout (2026-09-30)

Live Safari tracing found ICE entering `checking` on the bridge's first incoming
STUN check, before the player clicked Allow or applied the answer. It failed
47.424 seconds later although the invitation had minutes left. Candidate gathering
had completed in 107 ms; extending the gathering or invitation deadline would not
address this failure.

The bridge now applies the offer's credentials and fingerprint without its remote
candidates or end-of-candidates marker. It gathers and publishes its own candidates
normally, but waits with an open trickle checklist. Only after Allow applies the
answer does the browser send connectivity checks; werift learns a peer-reflexive
candidate and performs triggered checks. No application access is granted before
Allow. This requires a browser-to-bridge candidate path; different-network/NAT
coverage remains unmeasured and TURN remains a separate requirement.

Publication cannot overwrite a terminal or connected bridge state. `asking` is
documented as “answer published, awaiting browser connection,” because a browser
failure before the channel opens cannot be reported over that channel.

`test/test-web-agent-connect.js` holds consent for 65 seconds, verifies ICE remains
`new` throughout, then connects the same invitation and exercises screenshots,
input, permission refusal, and disconnect using the rebuilt shipped bridge.
The fixed bridge also passed delayed approval in the user's live Safari tab:
ICE stayed `new` while approval was pending, then moved from `checking` to
`connected` in 13 ms. Screenshots and a sustained Paint drawing session traversed
the DataChannel successfully; HTTP page evaluation was used only for diagnostics.

A useful acceptance test for [6]: give a *different* agent than the one that wrote it
nothing but the pasted sentence, and see if it gets to a screenshot.

## 6. Security summary

| Threat | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| Someone reads the berrry record | ciphertext under a 256-bit key that only the token holds |
| Token leaks via server logs | it lives in the URL fragment, which is never sent |
| Someone guesses the mailbox id | 128 random bits; and an answer they write can't be sealed |
| MITM on the DataChannel | the page fingerprint is in the token, and the bridge fingerprint is in the sealed answer |
| Token leaks (chat log) after use | one answer per peer connection, 10 min expiry |
| Token leaks before use | the player still has to Allow a bot name and key they don't recognize |
| A web page drives the local bridge | 127.0.0.1 only, random port, bearer secret, Host check |
| Tampered bridge script | sha256 in SKILL.md; the skill folder deploys as one unit |
| Agent overreach | page-side permission checks; eval off outside `?debug`; Take back / Disconnect |
| Bot spam in the store | captcha registration + per-key limits (berrry change 4) |

## 7. Open questions

- **Symmetric NAT on both ends** (some cellular carriers): host + STUN candidates won't
  connect, and it needs TURN. That's measured on first real use; the fallback is a
  berrry-hosted TURN with short-lived credentials.
- **`werift`** (pure-JS WebRTC, no native build, safe on the M1/x64 Node split) vs
  `node-datachannel` (native, faster). Pure JS is the default, because the bridge has to
  be a single downloadable file.
- **Bundle size** of `wine-agent.mjs` with werift inlined: measured at 1033 KB minified
  (werift 459 KB, then its x509/asn1 dependencies). That's a comfortable curl, so tier 1b
  isn't urgent. `tools/wine-agent/size-report.js` shows what could be stubbed.
- **Reconnect without a new link** (the same remembered agent after a page reload) needs
  the page to publish something, so it needs a player login or change 7. Deferred.
